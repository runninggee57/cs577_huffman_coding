have given their lives for their country and for the preservation of peace i have just met with the families of many of those who were killed i think all americans would cradle them in our arms if we could we share their sorrow i want all of you who lost loved ones and friends to know that the thoughts and prayers of this nation are with you if this country is to remain a force for good in the world we ll face times like these times of sadness and loss your fellow citizens know and appreciate that marines and their families are carrying a heavy burden america seeks no new territory nor do we wish to dominate others we commit our resources and risk the lives of those in our armed forces to rescue others from bloodshed and turmoil and to prevent humankind from drowning in a sea of tyranny in lebanon along with our allies we re working hard to help bring peace to that war torn country and stability to the vital middle east in seeking to stabilize the situation in lebanon you marines and sailors and our french italian and english companions are peacekeepers in the truest sense of the word the world looks to america for leadership and america looks to the men in its armed forces to the corps of marines to the navy the army freedom is being tested throughout the world in burma that government has announced conclusive evidence of north korean responsibility for the atrocity taking the lives of many members of the korean government we stand with south korea and i will be going there next week to carry our message to them a message of revulsion of this atrocity determination to stand with our friends in support of freedom in the middle east this morning we have learned of yet another terrorist assault similar to the attack against our marines this time against an israeli site in tyre lebanon in spite of the complexity and special hardships of the lebanese crisis we have stood firm as ever leathernecks are willing to accept their mission and do their duty this honest patriotism and dedication to duty overwhelms the rest of us in grenada our military forces moved quickly and professionally to protect american lives and respond to an urgent request from the organization of eastern caribbean states we joined in an effort to restore order and democracy to that strife torn island only days before our actions prime minister maurice bishop had been brutally murdered along with several members of his cabinet and unarmed civilians with a thousand americans including some 800 students on that island we weren t about to wait for the iran crisis to repeat itself only this time in our own neighborhood the caribbean in a free society there s bound to be disagreement about any decisive course of action some of those so quick to criticize our operation in grenada i invite them to read the letters i ve received from those students and their families they know this was no invasion they know it was a rescue mission marines have a saying we take care of our own well america with the help of marines will take care of our own and our brave marines soldiers and special forces including the truly gallant navy seals were not just coming to the aid of our students i hope every american will be able to hear the stories of the political prisoners who have been freed the citizens of grenada who watched helplessly as their country was being stolen from them and turned into a staging area for totalitarian aggression these same grenadians are hailing us as liberators and they re doing everything they can now to help every american can be proud of the professional and gallant job that our armed forces have done and all of us can rejoice that they re coming home i came here today to honor so many who did their duty and gave that last

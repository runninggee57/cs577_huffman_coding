fellow citizens of the senate and of the house of representatives in calling you together sooner than a separation from your homes would otherwise have been required i yielded to considerations drawn from the posture of our foreign affairs and in fixing the present for the time of your meeting regard was had to the probability of further developments of the policy of the belligerent powers toward this country which might the more unite the national councils in the measures to be pursued at the close of the last session of congress it was hoped that the successive confirmations of the extinction of the french decrees so far as they violated our neutral commerce would have induced the government of great britain to repeal its orders in council and thereby authorize a removal of the existing obstructions to her commerce with the united states instead of this reasonable step toward satisfaction and friendship between the two nations the orders were at a moment when least to have been expected put into more rigorous execution and it was communicated through the british envoy just arrived that whilst the revocation of the edicts of france as officially made known to the british government was denied to have taken place it was an indispensable condition of the repeal of the british orders that commerce should restored to a footing that would admit the productions and manufactures of great britain when owned by neutrals into markets shut against them by her enemy the united states being given to understand that in the mean time a continuance of their nonimportation act would lead to measures of retaliation at a later date it has indeed appeared that a communication to the british government of fresh evidence of the repeal of the french decrees against our neutral trade was followed by an intimation that it had been transmitted to the british plenipotentiary here in order that it might receive full consideration in the depending discussions this communication appears not to have been received but the transmission of it hither instead of founding on it an actual repeal of the orders or assurances that the repeal would ensue will not permit us to rely on any effective change in the british cabinet to be ready to meet with cordiality satisfactory proofs of such a change and to proceed in the mean time in adapting our measures to the views which have been disclosed through that minister will best consult our whole duty in the unfriendly spirit of those disclosures indemnity and redress for other wrongs have continued to be withheld and our coasts and the mouths of our harbors have again witnessed scenes not less derogatory to the dearest of our national rights than vexation to the regular course of our trade among the occurrences produced by the conduct of british ships of war hovering on our coasts was an encounter between 1 of them and the american frigate commanded by captain rodgers rendered unavoidable on the part of the latter by a fire commenced without cause by the former whose commander is therefore alone chargeable with the blood unfortunately shed in maintaining the honor of the american flag the proceedings of a court of inquiry requested by captain rodgers are communicated together with the correspondence relating to the occurrence between the secretary of state and his britannic majesty s envoy to these are added the several correspondences which have passed on the subject of the british orders in council and to both the correspondence relating to the floridas in which congress will be made acquainted with the interposition which the government of great britain has thought proper to make against the proceeding of the united states the justice and fairness which have been evinced on the part of the united states toward france both before and since the revocation of her decrees authorized an expectation that her government would have followed up that measure by all such others as were due to our reasonable claims as well s dictated by its amicable professions no proof however is yet given of an intention to repair the other wrongs done to the united states and particularly to restore the great amount of american property seized and condemned under edicts which though not affecting our neutral relations and therefore not entering into questions between the united states and other belligerents were nevertheless founded in such unjust principles that the reparation ought to have been prompt and ample in addition to this and other demands of strict right on that nation the united states have much reason to be dissatisfied with the rigorous and unexpected restrictions to which their trade with the french dominions has been subjected and which if not discontinued will require at least corresponding restrictions on importations from france into the united states on all those subjects our minister plenipotentiary lately sent to paris has carried with him the necessary instructions the result of which will be communicated to you by ascertaining the ulterior policy of the french government toward the united states will enable you to adapt to it that of the united states toward france our other foreign relations remain without unfavorable changes with russia they are on the best footing of friendship the ports of sweden have afforded proofs of friendly dispositions toward our commerce in the councils of that nation also and the information from our special minister to denmark shews that the mission had been attended with valuable effects to our citizens whose property had been so extensively violated and endangered by cruisers under the danish flag under the ominous indications which commanded attention it became a duty to exert the means committed to the executive department in providing for the general security the works of defense on our maritime frontier have accordingly been prosecuted with an activity leaving little to be added for the completion of the most important ones and as particularly suited for cooperation in emergencies a portion of the gun boats have in particular harbors been ordered into use the ships of war before in commission with the addition of a frigate have been chiefly employed as a cruising guard to the rights of our coast and such a disposition has been made of our land forces as was thought to promise the services most appropriate and important in this disposition is included a force consisting of regulars and militia embodied in the indiana territory and marched toward our northwestern frontier this measure was made requisite by several murders and depredations committed by indians but more especially by the menacing preparations and aspect of a combination of them on the wabash under the influence and direction of a fanatic of the shawanese tribe with these exceptions the indian tribes retain their peaceable dispositions toward us and their usual pursuits i must now add that the period is arrived which claims from the legislative guardians of the national rights a system of more ample provisions for maintaining them notwithstanding the scrupulous justice the protracted moderation and the multiplied efforts on the part of the united states to substitute for the accumulating dangers to the peace of the 2 countries all the mutual advantages of reestablished friendship and confidence we have seen that the british cabinet perseveres not only in withholding a remedy for other wrongs so long and so loudly calling for it but in the execution brought home to the threshold of our territory of measures which under existing circumstances have the character as well as the effect of war on our lawful commerce with this evidence of hostile inflexibility in trampling on rights which no independent nation can relinquish congress will feel the duty of putting the united states into an armor and an attitude demanded by the crisis and corresponding with the national spirit and expectations i recommend accordingly that adequate provisions be made for filling the ranks and prolonging the enlistments of the regular troops for an auxiliary force to be engaged for a more limited term for the acceptance of volunteer corps whose patriotic ardor may court a participation in urgent services for detachments as they may be wanted of other portions of the militia and for such a preparation of the great body as will proportion its usefulness to its intrinsic capacities nor can the occasion fail to remind you of the importance of those military seminaries which in every event will form a valuable and frugal part of our military establishment the manufacture of cannon and small arms has proceeded with due success and the stock and resources of all the necessary munitions are adequate to emergencies it will not be inexpedient however for congress to authorize an enlargement of them your attention will of course be drawn to such provisions on the subject of our naval force as may be required for the services to which it may be best adapted i submit to congress the seasonableness also of an authority to augment the stock of such materials as are imperishable in their nature or may not at once be attainable in contemplating the scenes which distinguish this momentous epoch and estimating their claims to our attention it is impossible to overlook those developing themselves among the great communities which occupy the southern portion of our own hemisphere and extend into our neighborhood an enlarged philanthropy and an enlightened forecast concur in imposing on the national councils an obligation to take a deep interest in their destinies to cherish reciprocal sentiments of good will to regard the progress of events and not to be unprepared for whatever order of things may be ultimately established under another aspect of our situation the early attention of congress will be due to the expediency of further guards against evasions and infractions of our commercial laws the practice of smuggling which is odious everywhere and particularly criminal in free governments where the laws being made by all for the good of all a fraud is committed on every individual as well as on the state attains its utmost guilt when it blends with a pursuit of ignominious gain a treacherous subserviency in the transgressors to a foreign policy adverse to that of their own country it is them that the virtuous indignation of the public should be enabled to manifest itself through the regular animadversions of the most competent laws to secure greater respect to our mercantile flag and to the honest interests which it covers it is expedient also that it be made punishable in our citizens to accepts licenses from foreign governments for a trade unlawfully interdicted by them to other american citizens or to trade under false colors or papers of any sort a prohibition is equally called for against the acceptance by our citizens of special licenses to be used in a trade with the united states and against the admission into particular ports of the united states of vessels from foreign countries authorized to trade with particular ports only although other subjects will press more immediately on your deliberations a portion of them can not but be well bestowed on the just and sound policy of securing to our manufactures the success they have attained and are still attaining in some degree under the impulse of causes not permanent and to our navigation the fair extent of which is at present abridged by the unequal regulations of foreign governments besides the reasonableness of saving our manufactures from sacrifices which a change of circumstances might bring on them the national interest requires that wrt such articles at least as belong to our defense and our primary wants we should not be left in unnecessary dependence on external supplies and whilst foreign governments adhere to the existing discriminations in their ports against our navigation and an equality or lesser discrimination is enjoyed by their navigation in our ports the effect can not be mistaken because it has been seriously felt by our shipping interests and in proportion as this takes place the advantages of an independent conveyance of our products to foreign markets and of a growing body of mariners trained by their occupations for the service of their country in times of danger must be diminished the receipts into the treasury during the year ending on the 30th day of september last have exceeded 13 5m and have enabled us to defray the current expenses including the interest on the public debt and to reimburse more than 5m of the principal without recurring to the loan authorized by the act of the last session the temporary loan obtained in the latter end of the year 1810 has also been reimbursed and is not included in that amount the decrease of revenue arising from the situation of our commerce and the extraordinary expenses which have and may become necessary must be taken into view in making commensurate provisions for the ensuing year and i recommend to your consideration the propriety of insuring a sufficiency of annual revenue at least to defray the ordinary expenses of government and to pay the interest on the public debt including that on new loans which may be authorized i can not close this communication without expressing my deep sense of the crisis in which you are assembled my confidence in a wise and honorable result to your deliberations and assurances of the faithful zeal with which my cooperating duties will be discharged invoking at the same time the blessing of heaven on our beloved country and on all the means that may be employed in vindicating its rights and advancing its welfare

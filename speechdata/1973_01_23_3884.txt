scrupulously adhered to we shall do everything the agreement requires of us and we shall expect the other parties to do everything it requires of them we shall also expect other interested nations to help insure that the agreement is carried out and peace is maintained as this long and very difficult war ends i would like to address a few special words to each of those who have been parties in the conflict first to the people and government of south vietnam by your courage by your sacrifice you have won the precious right to determine your own future and you have developed the strength to defend that right we look forward to working with you in the future friends in peace as we have been allies in war to the leaders of north vietnam as we have ended the war through negotiations let us now build a peace of reconciliation for our part we are prepared to make a major effort to help achieve that goal but just as reciprocity was needed to end the war so too will it be needed to build and strengthen the peace to the other major powers that have been involved even indirectly now is the time for mutual restraint so that the peace we have achieved can last and finally to all of you who are listening the american people your steadfastness in supporting our insistence on peace with honor has made peace with honor possible i know that you would not have wanted that peace jeopardized with our secret negotiations at the sensitive stage they were in during this recent period for me to have discussed publicly our efforts to secure peace would not only have violated our understanding with north vietnam it would have seriously harmed and possibly destroyed the chances for peace therefore i know that you now can understand why during these past several weeks i have not made any public statements about those efforts the important thing was not to talk about peace but to get peace and to get the right kind of peace this we have done now that we have achieved an honorable agreement let us be proud that america did not settle for a peace that would have betrayed our allies that would have abandoned our prisoners of war or that would have ended the war for us but would have continued the war for the 50 million people of indochina let us be proud of the 2 1 2 million young americans who served in vietnam who served with honor and distinction in one of the most selfless enterprises in the history of nations and let us be proud of those who sacrificed who gave their lives so that the people of south vietnam might live in freedom and so that the world might live in peace in particular i would like to say a word to some of the bravest people i have ever met the wives the children the families of our prisoners of war and the missing in action when others called on us to settle on any terms you had the courage to stand for the right kind of peace so that those who died and those who suffered would not have died and suffered in vain and so that where this generation knew war the next generation would know peace nothing means more to me at this moment than the fact that your long vigil is coming to an end just yesterday a great american who once occupied this office died in his life president johnson endured the vilification of those who sought to portray him as a man of war but there was nothing he cared about more deeply than achieving a lasting peace in the world i remember the last time i talked with him it was just the day after new year s he spoke then of his concern with bringing peace with making it the right kind of peace and i was grateful that he once again expressed his support for my efforts to gain such a peace no one would have welcomed this peace more than he and i know he would join me in asking for those who died and for those who live let us consecrate this moment by resolving together to make the peace we have achieved a peace that will last thank you and good evening

thank you very much thank you please be seated those who live today remember those who do not those who know freedom remember today those who gave up life for freedom today in honor of the dead we conduct ceremonies we lay wreaths we speak words of tribute and in our memories in our hearts we hold them close to us still yet we also know even as their families knew when they last looked upon them that they can never be fully ours again that they belong now to god and to that for which they so selflessly made a final and eternal act of devotion we could not forget them even if they were not our own we could not forget them for all time they are what we can only aspire to be giving unselfish the epitome of human love to lay down one s life so that others might live we think on their lives we think on their final moments in our mind s eye we see young americans in a european forest or on an asian island or at sea or in aerial combat and as life expired we know that those who could had last thoughts of us and of their love for us as they thought of us then so too we think of them now with love with devotion and with faith the certainty that what they died for was worthy of their sacrifice faith too in god and in the nation that has pledged itself to his work and to the dream of human freedom and a nation too that today and always pledges itself to their eternal memory thank you god bless you

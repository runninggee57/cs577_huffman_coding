in the life of a nation we re called upon to define who we are and what we believe sometimes these choices are not easy but today as president i ask for your support in a decision i ve made to stand up for what s right and condemn what s wrong all in the cause of peace at my direction elements of the 82d airborne division as well as key units of the united states air force are arriving today to take up defensive positions in saudi arabia i took this action to assist the saudi arabian government in the defense of its homeland no one commits america s armed forces to a dangerous mission lightly but after perhaps unparalleled international consultation and exhausting every alternative it became necessary to take this action let me tell you why less than a week ago in the early morning hours of august 2d iraqi armed forces without provocation or warning invaded a peaceful kuwait facing negligible resistance from its much smaller neighbor iraq s tanks stormed in blitzkrieg fashion through kuwait in a few short hours with more than 100 000 troops along with tanks artillery and surface to surface missiles iraq now occupies kuwait this aggression came just hours after saddam hussein specifically assured numerous countries in the area that there would be no invasion there is no justification whatsoever for this outrageous and brutal act of aggression a puppet regime imposed from the outside is unacceptable the acquisition of territory by force is unacceptable no one friend or foe should doubt our desire for peace and no one should underestimate our determination to confront aggression four simple principles guide our policy first we seek the immediate unconditional and complete withdrawal of all iraqi forces from kuwait second kuwait s legitimate government must be restored to replace the puppet regime and third my administration as has been the case with every president from president roosevelt to president reagan is committed to the security and stability of the persian gulf and fourth i am determined to protect the lives of american citizens abroad immediately after the iraqi invasion i ordered an embargo of all trade with iraq and together with many other nations announced sanctions that both freeze all iraqi assets in this country and protected kuwait s assets the stakes are high iraq is already a rich and powerful country that possesses the world s second largest reserves of oil and over a million men under arms it s the fourth largest military in the world our country now imports nearly half the oil it consumes and could face a major threat to its economic independence much of the world is even more dependent upon imported oil and is even more vulnerable to iraqi threats we succeeded in the struggle for freedom in europe because we and our allies remain stalwart keeping the peace in the middle east will require no less we re beginning a new era this new era can be full of promise an age of freedom a time of peace for all peoples but if history teaches us anything it is that we must resist aggression or it will destroy our freedoms appeasement does not work as was the case in the 1930 s we see in saddam hussein an aggressive dictator threatening his neighbors only 14 days ago saddam hussein promised his friends he would not invade kuwait and 4 days ago he promised the world he would withdraw and twice we have seen what his promises mean his promises mean nothing in the last few days i ve spoken with political leaders from the middle east europe asia and the americas and i ve met with prime minister thatcher prime minister mulroney and nato secretary general woerner and all agree that iraq cannot be allowed to benefit from its invasion of kuwait we agree that this is not an american problem or a european problem or a middle east problem it is the world s problem and that s why soon after the iraqi invasion the united nations security council without dissent condemned iraq calling for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of its troops from kuwait the arab world through both the arab league and the gulf cooperation council courageously announced its opposition to iraqi aggression japan the united kingdom and france and other governments around the world have imposed severe sanctions the soviet union and china ended all arms sales to iraq and this past monday the united nations security council approved for the first time in 23 years mandatory sanctions under chapter vii of the united nations charter these sanctions now enshrined in international law have the potential to deny iraq the fruits of aggression while sharply limiting its ability to either import or export anything of value especially oil i pledge here today that the united states will do its part to see that these sanctions are effective and to induce iraq to withdraw without delay from kuwait but we must recognize that iraq may not stop using force to advance its ambitions iraq has massed an enormous war machine on the saudi border capable of initiating hostilities with little or no additional preparation given the iraqi government s history of aggression against its own citizens as well as its neighbors to assume iraq will not attack again would be unwise and unrealistic and therefore after consulting with king fahd i sent secretary of defense dick cheney to discuss cooperative measures we could take following those meetings the saudi government requested our help and i responded to that request by ordering u s air and ground forces to deploy to the kingdom of saudi arabia let me be clear the sovereign independence of saudi arabia is of vital interest to the united states this decision which i shared with the congressional leadership grows out of the longstanding friendship and security relationship between the united states and saudi arabia u s forces will work together with those of saudi arabia and other nations to preserve the integrity of saudi arabia and to deter further iraqi aggression through their presence as well as through training and exercises these multinational forces will enhance the overall capability of saudi armed forces to defend the kingdom i want to be clear about what we are doing and why america does not seek conflict nor do we seek to chart the destiny of other nations but america will stand by her friends the mission of our troops is wholly defensive hopefully they will not be needed long they will not initiate hostilities but they will defend themselves the kingdom of saudi arabia and other friends in the persian gulf we are working around the clock to deter iraqi aggression and to enforce u n sanctions i m continuing my conversations with world leaders secretary of defense cheney has just returned from valuable consultations with president mubarak of egypt and king hassan of morocco secretary of state baker has consulted with his counterparts in many nations including the soviet union and today he heads for europe to consult with president ozal of turkey a staunch friend of the united states and he ll then consult with the nato foreign ministers i will ask oil producing nations to do what they can to increase production in order to minimize any impact that oil flow reductions will have on the world economy and i will explore whether we and our allies should draw down our strategic petroleum reserves conservation measures can also help americans everywhere must do their part and one more thing i m asking the oil companies to do their fair share they should show restraint and not abuse today s uncertainties to raise prices standing up for our principles will not come easy it may take time and possibly cost a great deal but we are asking no more of anyone than of the brave young men and women of our armed forces and their families and i ask that in the churches around the country prayers be said for those who are committed to protect and defend america s interests standing up for our principle is an american tradition as it has so many times before it may take time and tremendous effort but most of all it will take unity of purpose as i ve witnessed throughout my life in both war and peace america has never wavered when her purpose is driven by principle and in this august day at home and abroad i know she will do no less thank you and god bless the united states of america

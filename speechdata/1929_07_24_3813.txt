nations of the world that they should enter into a binding agreement as follows article 1 the high contracting parties solemnly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another article 2 the high contracting parties agree that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be which may arise among them shall never be sought except by pacific means that was a proposal to the conscience and idealism of civilized nations it suggested a new step in international law rich with meaning pregnant with new ideas in the conduct of world relations it represented a platform from which there is instant appeal to the public opinion of the world as to specific acts and deeds the magnificent response of the world to these proposals is well indicated by those now

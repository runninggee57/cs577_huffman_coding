fellow citizens of the senate and of the house of representatives since the commencement of the term for which i have been again called into office no fit occasion has arisen for expressing to me fellow citizens at large the deep and respectful sense which i feel of the renewed testimony of public approbation while on the one hand it awakened my gratitude for all those instances of affectionate partiality with which i have been honored by my country on the other it could not prevent an earnest wish for that retirement from which no private consideration should ever have torn me but influenced by the belief that my conduct would be estimated according to its real motives and that the people and the authorities derived from them would support exertions having nothing personal for their object i have obeyed the suffrage which commanded me to resume the executive power and i humbly implore that being on whose will the fate of nations depends to crown with success our mutual endeavors for the general happiness as soon as the war in europe had embraced those powers with whom the united states have the most extensive relations there was reason to apprehend that our intercourse with them might be interrupted and our disposition for peace drawn into question by the suspicions too often entertained by belligerent nations it seemed therefore to be my duty to admonish our citizens of the consequences of a contraband trade and of hostile acts to any of the parties and to obtain by a declaration of the existing legal state of things an easier admission of our right to the immunities belonging to our situation under these impressions the proclamation which will be laid before you was issued in this posture of affairs both new and delicate i resolved to adopt general rules which should conform to the treaties and assert the privileges of the united states these were reduced into a system which will be communicated to you although i have not thought of myself at liberty to forbid the sale of the prizes permitted by our treaty of commerce with france to be brought into our ports i have not refused to cause them to be restored when they were taken within the protection of our territory or by vessels commissioned or equipped in a warlike form within the limits of the united states it rests with the wisdom of congress to correct improve or enforce this plan of procedure and it will probably be found expedient to extend the legal code and the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states to many cases which though dependent on principles already recognized demand some further provisions where individuals shall within the united states array themselves in hostility against any of the powers at war or enter upon military expeditions or enterprises within the jurisdiction of the united states or usurp and exercise judicial authority within the united states or where the penalties on violations of the law of nations may have been indistinctly marked or are inadequate these offenses can not receive too early and close an attention and require prompt and decisive remedies whatsoever those remedies may be they will be well administered by the judiciary who possess a long established course of investigation effectual process and officers in the habit of executing it in like manner as several of the courts have doubted under particular circumstances their power to liberate the vessels of a nation at peace and even of a citizen of the united states although seized under a false color of being hostile property and have denied their power to liberate certain captures within the protection of our territory it would seem proper to regulate their jurisdiction in these points but if the executive is to be the resort in either of the two last mentioned cases it is hoped that he will be authorized by law to have facts ascertained by the courts when for his own information he shall request it i can not recommend to your notice measures for the fulfillment of our duties to the rest of the world without again pressing upon you the necessity of placing ourselves in a condition of complete defense and of exacting from them the fulfillment of their duties toward us the united states ought not to indulge a persuasion that contrary to the order of human events they will forever keep at a distance those painful appeals to arms with which the history of every other nation abounds there is a rank due to the united states among nations which will be withheld if not absolutely lost by the reputation of weakness if we desire to avoid insult we must be able to repel it if we desire to secure peace one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity it must be known that we are at all times ready for war the documents which will be presented to you will shew the amount and kinds of arms and military stores now in our magazines and arsenals and yet an addition even to these supplies can not with prudence be neglected as it would leave nothing to the uncertainty of procuring warlike apparatus in the moment of public danger nor can such arrangements with such objects be exposed to the censure or jealousy of the warmest friends of republican government they are incapable of abuse in the hands of the militia who ought to possess a pride in being the depository of the force of the republic and may be trained to a degree of energy equal to every military exigency of the united states but it is an inquiry which can not be too solemnly pursued whether the act more effectually to provide for the national defense by establishing an uniform militia throughout the united states has organized them so as to produce their full effect whether your own experience in the several states has not detected some imperfections in the scheme and whether a material feature in an improvement of it ought not to be to afford an opportunity for the study of those branches of the military art which can scarcely ever be attained by practice alone the connection of the united states with europe has become extremely interesting the occurrences which relate to it and have passed under the knowledge of the executive will be exhibited to congress in a subsequent communication when we contemplate the war on our frontiers it may be truly affirmed that every reasonable effort has been made to adjust the causes of dissension with the indians north of the ohio the instructions given to the commissioners evince a moderation and equity proceeding from a sincere love of peace and a liberality having no restriction but the essential interests and dignity of the united states the attempt however of an amicable negotiation having been frustrated the troops have marched to act offensively although the proposed treaty did not arrest the progress of military preparation it is doubtful how far the advance of the season before good faith justified active movements may retard them during the remainder of the year from the papers and intelligence which relate to this important subject you will determine whether the deficiency in the number of troops granted by law shall be compensated by succors of militia or additional encouragements shall be proposed to recruits an anxiety has been also demonstrated by the executive for peace with the creeks and the cherokees the former have been relieved with corn and with clothing and offensive measures against them prohibited during the recess of congress to satisfy the complaints of the latter prosecutions have been instituted for the violences committed upon them but the papers which will be delivered to you disclose the critical footing on which we stand in regard to both those tribes and it is with congress to pronounce what shall be done after they shall have provided for the present emergency it will merit their most serious labors to render tranquillity with the savages permanent by creating ties of interest next to a rigorous execution of justice on the violators of peace the establishment of commerce with the indian nations in behalf of the united states is most likely to conciliate their attachment but it ought to be conducted without fraud without extortion with constant and plentiful supplies with a ready market for the commodities of the indians and a stated price for what they give in payment and receive in exchange individuals will not pursue such a traffic unless they be allured by the hope of profit but it will be enough for the united states to be reimbursed only should this recommendation accord with the opinion of congress they will recollect that it can not be accomplished by any means yet in the hands of the executive gentlemen of the house of representatives the commissioners charged with the settlement of accounts between the united states and individual states concluded their important function within the time limited by law and the balances struck in their report which will be laid before congress have been placed on the books of the treasury on the first day of june last an installment of 1 000 000 florins became payable on the loans of the united states in holland this was adjusted by a prolongation of the period of reimbursement in nature of a new loan at an interest of 5 for the term of ten years and the expenses of this operation were a commission of 3 the first installment of the loan of 2 000 000 from the bank of the united states has been paid as was directed by law for the second it is necessary that provision be made no pecuniary consideration is more urgent than the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt on none can delay be more injurious or an economy of time more valuable the productiveness of the public revenues hitherto has continued to equal the anticipations which were formed of it but it is not expected to prove commensurate with all the objects which have been suggested some auxiliary provisions will therefore it is presumed be requisite and it is hoped that these may be made consistently with a due regard to the convenience of our citizens who can not but be sensible of the true wisdom of encountering a small present addition to their contributions to obviate a future accumulation of burthens but here i can not forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the transportation of public prints there is no resource so firm for the government of the united states as the affections of the people guided by an enlightened policy and to this primary good nothing can conduce more than a faithful representation of public proceedings diffused without restraint throughout the united states an estimate of the appropriations necessary for the current service of the ensuing year and a statement of a purchase of arms and military stores made during the recess will be presented to congress gentlemen of the senate and of the house of representatives the several subjects to which i have now referred open a wide range to your deliberations and involve some of the choicest interests of our common country permit me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude of your task without an unprejudiced coolness the welfare of the government may be hazarded without harmony as far as consists with freedom of sentiment its dignity may be lost but as the legislative proceedings of the united states will never i trust be reproached for the want of temper or of candor so shall not the public happiness languish from the want of my strenuous and warmest cooperation

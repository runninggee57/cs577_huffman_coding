gentlemen of the senate on the eighteenth of december last i addressed an identic note to the governments of the nations now at war requesting them to state more definitely than they had yet been stated by either group of belligerents the terms upon which they would deem it possible to make peace i spoke on behalf of humanity and of the rights of all neutral nations like our own many of whose most vital interests the war puts in constant jeopardy the central powers united in a reply which stated merely that they were ready to meet their antagonists in conference to discuss terms of peace the entente powers have replied much more definitely and have stated in general terms indeed but with sufficient definiteness to imply details the arrangements guarantees and acts of reparation which they deem to be the indispensable conditions of a satisfactory settlement we are that much nearer a definite discussion of the peace which shall end the present war we are that much nearer the discussion of the international concert which must thereafter hold the world at peace in every discussion of the peace that must end this war it is taken for granted that that peace must be followed by some definite concert of power which will make it virtually impossible that any such catastrophe should ever overwhelm us again every lover of mankind every sane and thoughtful man must take that for granted i have sought this opportunity to address you because i thought that i owed it to you as the council associated with me in the final determination of our international obligations to disclose to you without reserve the thought and purpose that have been taking form in my mind in regard to the duty of our government in the days to come when it will be necessary to lay afresh and upon a new plan the foundations of peace among the nations it is inconceivable that the people of the united states should play no part in that great enterprise to take part in such a service will be the opportunity for which they have sought to prepare themselves by the very principles and purposes of their polity and the approved practices of their government ever since the days when they set up a new nation in the high and honorable hope that it might in all that it was and did show mankind the way to liberty they cannot in honor withhold the service to which they are now about to be challenged they do not wish to withhold it but they owe it to themselves and to the other nations of the world to state the conditions under which they will feel free to render it that service is nothing less than this to add their authority and their power to the authority and force of other nations to guarantee peace and justice throughout the world such a settlement cannot now be long postponed it is right that before it comes this government should frankly formulate the conditions upon which it would feel justified in asking our people to approve its formal and solemn adherence to a league for peace i am here to attempt to state those conditions the present war must first be ended but we owe it to candor and to a just regard for the opinion of mankind to say that so far as our participation in guarantees of future peace is concerned it makes a great deal of difference in what way and upon what terms it is ended the treaties and agreements which bring it to an end must embody terms which will create a peace that is worth guaranteeing and preserving a peace that will win the approval of mankind not merely a peace that will serve the several interests and immediate aims of the nations engaged we shall have no voice in determining what those terms shall be but we shall i feel sure have a voice in determining whether they shall be made lasting or not by the guarantees of a universal covenant and our judgment upon what is fundamental and essential as a condition precedent to permanency should be spoken now not afterwards when it may be too late no covenant of cooperative peace that does not include the peoples of the new world can suffice to keep the future safe against war and yet there is only one sort of peace that the peoples of america could join in guaranteeing the elements of that peace must be elements that engage the confidence and satisfy the principles of the american governments elements consistent with their political faith and with the practical convictions which the peoples of america have once for all embraced and undertaken to defend i do not mean to say that any american government would throw any obstacle in the way of any terms of peace the governments now at war might agree upon or seek to upset them when made whatever they might be i only take it for granted that mere terms of peace between the belligerents will not satisfy even the belligerents themselves mere agreements may not make peace secure it will be absolutely necessary that a force be created as a guarantor of the permanency of the settlement so much greater than the force of any nation now engaged or any alliance hitherto formed or projected that no nation no probable combination of nations could face or withstand it if the peace presently to be made is to endure it must be a peace made secure by the organized major force of mankind the terms of the immediate peace agreed upon will determine whether it is a peace for which such a guarantee can be secured the question upon which the whole future peace and policy of the world depends is this is the present war a struggle for a just and secure peace or only for a new balance of power if it be only a struggle for a new balance of power who will guarantee who can guarantee the stable equilibrium of the new arrangement only a tranquil europe can be a stable europe there must be not a balance of power but a community of power not organized rivalries but an organized common peace fortunately we have received very explicit assurances on this point the statesmen of both of the groups of nations now arrayed against one another have said in terms that could not be misinterpreted that it was no part of the purpose they had in mind to crush their antagonists but the implications of these assurances may not be equally clear to all may not be the same on both sides of the water i think it will be serviceable if i attempt to set forth what we understand them to be they imply first of all that it must be a peace without victory it is not pleasant to say this i beg that i may be permitted to put my own interpretation upon it and that it may be understood that no other interpretation was in my thought i am seeking only to face realities and to face them without soft concealments victory would mean peace forced upon the loser a victor s terms imposed upon the vanquished it would be accepted in humiliation under duress at an intolerable sacrifice and would leave a sting a resentment a bitter memory upon which terms of peace would rest not permanently but only as upon quicksand only a peace between equals can last only a peace the very principle of which is equality and a common participation in a common benefit the right state of mind the right feeling between nations is as necessary for a lasting peace as is the just settlement of vexed questions of territory or of racial and national allegiance the equality of nations upon which peace must be founded if it is to last must be an equality of rights the guarantees exchanged must neither recognize nor imply a difference between big nations and small between those that are powerful and those that are weak right must be based upon the common strength not upon the individual strength of the nations upon whose concert peace will depend equality of territory or of resources there of course cannot be nor any other sort of equality not gained in the ordinary peaceful and legitimate development of the peoples themselves but no one asks or expects anything more than an equality of rights mankind is looking now for freedom of life not for equipoises of power and there is a deeper thing involved than even equality of right among organized nations no peace can last or ought to last which does not recognize and accept the principle that governments derive all their just powers from the consent of the governed and that no right anywhere exists to hand peoples about from sovereignty to sovereignty as if they were property i take it for granted for instance if i may venture upon a single example that statesmen everywhere are agreed that there should be a united independent and autonomous poland and that henceforth inviolable security of life of worship and of industrial and social development should be guaranteed to all peoples who have lived hitherto under the power of governments devoted to a faith and purpose hostile to their own i speak of this not because of any desire to exalt an abstract political principle which has always been held very dear by those who have sought to build up liberty in america but for the same reason that i have spoken of the other conditions of peace which seem to me clearly indispensable because i wish frankly to uncover realities any peace which does not recognize and accept this principle will inevitably be upset it will not rest upon the affections or the convictions of mankind the ferment of spirit of whole populations will fight subtly and constantly against it and all the world will sympathize the world can be at peace only if its life is stable and there can be no stability where the will is in rebellion where there is not tranquillity of spirit and a sense of justice of freedom and of right so far as practicable moreover every great people now struggling towards a full development of its resources and of its powers should be assured a direct outlet to the great highways of the sea where this cannot be done by the cession of territory it can no doubt be done by the neutralization of direct rights of way under the general guarantee which will assure the peace itself with a right comity of arrangement no nation need be shut away from free access to the open paths of the world s commerce and the paths of the sea must alike in law and in fact be free the freedom of the seas is the sine qua non of peace equality and cooperation no doubt a somewhat radical reconsideration of many of the rules of international practice hitherto thought to be established may be necessary in order to make the seas indeed free and common in practically all circumstances for the use of mankind but the motive for such changes is convincing and compelling there can be no trust or intimacy between the peoples of the world without them the free constant unthreatened intercourse of nations is an essential part of the process of peace and of development it need not be difficult either to define or to secure the freedom of the seas if the governments of the world sincerely desire to come to an agreement concerning it it is a problem closely connected with the limitation of naval armaments and the cooperation of the navies of the world in keeping the seas at once free and safe and the question of limiting naval armaments opens the wider and perhaps more difficult question of the limitation of armies and of all programs of military preparation difficult and delicate as these questions are they must be faced with the utmost candor and decided in a spirit of real accommodation if peace is to come with healing in its wings and come to stay peace cannot be had without concession and sacrifice there can be no sense of safety and equality among the nations if great preponderating armaments are henceforth to continue here and there to be built up and maintained the statesmen of the world must plan for peace and nations must adjust and accommodate their policy to it as they have planned for war and made ready for pitiless contest and rivalry the question of armaments whether on land or sea is the most immediately and intensely practical question connected with the future fortunes of nations and of mankind i have spoken upon these great matters without reserve and with the utmost explicitness because it has seemed to me to be necessary if the world s yearning desire for peace was anywhere to find free voice and utterance perhaps i am the only person in high authority amongst all the peoples of the world who is at liberty to speak and hold nothing back i am speaking as an individual and yet i am speaking also of course as the responsible head of a great government and i feel confident that i have said what the people of the united states would wish me to say may i not add that i hope and believe that i am in effect speaking for liberals and friends of humanity in every nation and of every program of liberty i would fain believe that i am speaking for the silent mass of mankind everywhere who have as yet had no place or opportunity to speak their real hearts out concerning the death and ruin they see to have come already upon the persons and the homes they hold most dear and in holding out the expectation that the people and government of the united states will join the other civilized nations of the world in guaranteeing the permanence of peace upon such terms as i have named i speak with the greater boldness and confidence because it is clear to every man who can think that there is in this promise no breach in either our traditions or our policy as a nation but a fulfilment rather of all that we have professed or striven for i am proposing as it were that the nations should with one accord adopt the doctrine of president monroe as the doctrine of the world that no nation should seek to extend its polity over any other nation or people but that every people should be left free to determine its own polity its own way of development unhindered unthreatened unafraid the little along with the great and powerful i am proposing that all nations henceforth avoid entangling alliances which would draw them into competitions of power catch them in a net of intrigue and selfish rivalry and disturb their own affairs with influences intruded from without there is no entangling alliance in a concert of power when all unite to act in the same sense and with the same purpose all act in the common interest and are free to live their own lives under a common protection i am proposing government by the consent of the governed that freedom of the seas which in international conference after conference representatives of the united states have urged with the eloquence of those who are the convinced disciples of liberty and that moderation of armaments which makes of armies and navies a power for order merely not an instrument of aggression or of selfish violence these are american principles american policies we could stand for no others and they are also the principles and policies of forward looking men and women everywhere of every modern nation of every enlightened community they are the principles of mankind and must prevail

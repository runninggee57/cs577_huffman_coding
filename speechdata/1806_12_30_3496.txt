my children the wolf and people of the mandan nation i take you by the hand of friendship hearty welcome to the seat of the government of the united states the journey which you have taken to visit your fathers on this side of our island is a long one and your having undertaken it is a proof that you desired to become acquainted with us i thank the great spirit that he has protected you through the journey and brought you safely to the residence of your friends and i hope he will have you constantly in his safe keeping and restore you in good health to your nations and families my friends and children we are descended from the old nations which live beyond the great water but we and our forefathers have been so long here that we seem like you to have grown out of this land we consider ourselves no longer of the old nations beyond the great water but as united in one family with our red brethren here the french the english the spaniards have now agreed with us to retire from all the country which you and we hold between canada and mexico and never more to return to it and remember the words i now speak to you my children they are never to return again we are now your fathers and you shall not lose by the change as soon as spain had agreed to withdraw from all the waters of the missouri and mississippi i felt the desire of becoming acquainted with all my red children beyond the mississippi and of uniting them with us as we have those on this side of that river in the bonds of peace and friendship i wished to learn what we could do to benefit them by furnishing them the necessaries they want in exchange for their furs and peltries i therefore sent our beloved man captain lewis one of my own family to go up the missouri river to get acquainted with all the indian nations in its neighborhood to take them by the hand deliver my talks to them and to inform us in what way we could be useful to them your nation received him kindly you have taken him by the hand and been friendly to him my children i thank you for the services you rendered him and for your attention to his words he will now tell us where we should establish trading houses to be convenient to you all and what we must send to them my friends and children i have now an important advice to give you i have already told you that you and all the red men are my children and i wish you to live in peace and friendship with one another as brethren of the same family ought to do how much better is it for neighbors to help than to hurt one another how much happier must it make them if you will cease to make war on one another if you will live in friendship with all mankind you can employ all your time in providing food and clothing for yourselves and your families your men will not be destroyed in war and your women and children will lie down to sleep in their cabins without fear of being surprised by their enemies and killed or carried away your numbers will be increased instead of diminishing and you will live in plenty and in quiet my children i have given this advice to all your red brethren on this side of the mississippi they are following it they are increasing in their numbers are learning to clothe and provide for their families as we do remember then my advice my children carry it home to your people and tell them that from the day that they have become all of the same family from the day that we became father to them all we wish as a true father should do that we may all live together as one household and that before they strike one another they should go to their father and let him endeavor to make up the quarrel my children you are come from the other side of our great island from where the sun sets to see your new friends at the sun rising you have now arrived where the waters are constantly rising and falling every day but you are still distant from the sea i very much desire that you should not stop here but go and see your brethren as far as the edge of the great water i am persuaded you have so far seen that every man by the way has received you as his brothers and has been ready to do you all the kindness in his power you will see the same thing quite to the sea shore and i wish you therefore to go and visit our great cities in that quarter and see how many friends and brothers you have here you will then have travelled a long line from west to east and if you had time to go from north to south from canada to florida you would find it as long in that direction and all the people as sincerely your friends i wish you my children to see all you can and to tell your people all you see because i am sure the more they know of us the more they will be our hearty friends i invite you therefore to pay a visit to baltimore philadelphia new york and the cities still beyond that if you are willing to go further we will provide carriages to convey you and a person to go with you to see that you want for nothing by the time you come back the snows will be melted on the mountains the ice in the rivers broken up and you will be wishing to set out on your return home my children i have long desired to see you i have now opened my heart to you let my words sink into your hearts and never be forgotten if ever lying people or bad spirits should raise up clouds between us call to mind what i have said and what you have seen yourselves be sure there are some lying spirits between us let us come together as friends and explain to each other what is misrepresented or misunderstood the clouds will fly away like morning fog and the sun of friendship appear and shine forever bright and clear between us my children it may happen that while you are here occasion may arise to talk about many things which i do not now particularly mention the secretary at war will always be ready to talk with you and you are to consider whatever he says as said by myself he will also take care of you and see that you are furnished with all comforts here

to the congress of the united states the present state of the union upon which it is customary for the president to report to the congress under the provisions of the constitution is such that it may be regarded with encouragement and satisfaction by every american our country is almost unique in its ability to discharge fully and promptly all its obligations at home and abroad and provide for all its inhabitants an increase in material resources in intellectual vigor and in moral power the nation holds a position unsurpassed in all former human experience this does not mean that we do not have any problems it is elementary that the increasing breadth of our experience necessarily increases the problems of our national life but it does mean that if all will but apply ourselves industriously and honestly we have ample powers with which to meet our problems and provide for i heir speedy solution i do not profess that we can secure an era of perfection in human existence but we can provide an era of peace and prosperity attended with freedom and justice and made more and more satisfying by the ministrations of the charities and humanities of life our domestic problems are for the most part economic we have our enormous debt to pay and we are paying it we have the high cost of government to diminish and we are diminishing it we have a heavy burden of taxation to reduce and we are reducing it but while remarkable progress has been made in these directions the work is yet far from accomplished we still owe over 21 000 000 000 the cost of the national government is still about 3 500 000 000 and the national taxes still amount to about 27 for each one of our inhabitants there yet exists this enormous field for the application of economy in my opinion the government can do more to remedy the economic ills of the people by a system of rigid economy in public expenditure than can be accomplished through any other action the costs of our national and local governments combined now stand at a sum close to 100 for each inhabitant of the land a little less than one third of this is represented by national expenditure and a little more than two thirds by local expenditure it is an ominous fact that only the national government is reducing its debt others are increasing theirs at about 1 000 000 000 each year the depression that overtook business the disaster experienced in agriculture the lack of employment and the terrific shrinkage in all values which our country experienced in a most acute form in 1920 resulted in no small measure from the prohibitive taxes which were then levied on all productive effort the establishment of a system of drastic economy in public expenditure which has enabled us to pay off about one fifth of the national debt since 1919 and almost cut in two the national tax burden since 1921 has been one of the main causes in reestablishing a prosperity which has come to include within its benefits almost every one of our inhabitants economy reaches everywhere it carries a blessing to everybody the fallacy of the claim that the costs of government are borne by the rich and those who make a direct contribution to the national treasury can not be too often exposed no system has been devised i do not think any system could be devised under which any person living in this country could escape being affected by the cost of our government it has a direct effect both upon the rate and the purchasing power of wages it is felt in the price of those prime necessities of existence food clothing fuel and shelter it would appear to be elementary that the more the government expends the more it must require every producer to contribute out of his production to the public treasury and the less he will have for his own benefit the continuing costs of public administration can be met in only one way by the work of the people the higher they become the more the people must work for the government the less they are the more the people can work for themselves the present estimated margin between public receipts and expenditures for this fiscal year is very small perhaps the most important work that this session of the congress can do is to continue a policy of economy and further reduce the cost of government in order that we may have a reduction of taxes for the next fiscal year nothing is more likely to produce that public confidence which is the forerunner and the mainstay of prosperity encourage and enlarge business opportunity with ample opportunity for employment at good wages provide a larger market for agricultural products and put our country in a stronger position to be able to meet the world competition in trade than a continuing policy of economy of course necessary costs must be met proper functions of the government performed and constant investments for capital account and reproductive effort must be carried on by our various departments but the people must know that their government is placing upon them no unnecessary burden taxes everyone desires a reduction of taxes and there is a great preponderance of sentiment in favor of taxation reform when i approved the present tax law i stated publicly that i did so in spite of certain provisions which i believed unwise and harmful one of the most glaring of these was the making public of the amounts assessed against different income tax payers although that damage has now been done i believe its continuation to be detrimental to the public welfare and bound to decrease public revenues so that it ought to be repealed anybody can reduce taxes but it is not so easy to stand in the gap and resist the passage of increasing appropriation bills which would make tax reduction impossible it will be very easy to measure the strength of the attachment to reduced taxation by the power with which increased appropriations are resisted if at the close of the present session the congress has kept within the budget which i propose to present it will then be possible to have a moderate amount of tax reduction and all the tax reform that the congress may wish for during the next fiscal year the country is now feeling the direct stimulus which came from the passage of the last revenue bill and under the assurance of a reasonable system of taxation there is every prospect of an era of prosperity of unprecedented proportions but it would be idle to expect any such results unless business can continue free from excess profits taxation and be accorded a system of surtaxes at rates which have for their object not the punishment of success or the discouragement of business but the production of the greatest amount of revenue from large incomes i am convinced that the larger incomes of the country would actually yield more revenue to the government if the basis of taxation were scientifically revised downward moreover the effect of the present method of this taxation is to increase the cost of interest on productive enterprise and to increase the burden of rent it is altogether likely that such reduction would so encourage and stimulate investment that it would firmly establish our country in the economic leadership of the world waterways meantime our internal development should go on provision should be made for flood control of such rivers as the mississippi and the colorado and for the opening up of our inland waterways to commerce consideration is due to the project of better navigation from the great lakes to the gulf every effort is being made to promote an agreement with canada to build the st lawrence waterway there are pending before the congress bills for further development of the mississippi basin for the taking over of the cape cod canal in accordance with a moral obligation which seems to have been incurred during the war and for the improvement of harbors on both the pacific and the atlantic coasts while this last should be divested of some of its projects and we must proceed slowly these bills in general have my approval such works are productive of wealth and in the long run tend to a reduction of the tax burden reclamation our country has a well defined policy of reclamation established under statutory authority this policy should be continued and made a self sustaining activity administered in a manner that will meet local requirements and bring our and lands into a profitable state of cultivation as fast as there is a market for their products legislation is pending based on the report of the fact finding commission for the proper relief of those needing extension of time in which to meet their payments on irrigated land and for additional amendments and reforms of our reclamation laws which are all exceedingly important and should be enacted at once no more important development has taken place in the last year than the beginning of a restoration of agriculture to a prosperous condition we must permit no division of classes in this country with one occupation striving to secure advantage over another each must proceed under open opportunities and with a fair prospect of economic equality the government can not successfully insure prosperity or fix prices by legislative fiat every business has its risk and its times of depression it is well known that in the long run there will be a more even prosperity and a more satisfactory range of prices under the natural working out of economic laws than when the government undertakes the artificial support of markets and industries still we can so order our affairs so protect our own people from foreign competition so arrange our national finances so administer our monetary system so provide for the extension of credits so improve methods of distribution as to provide a better working machinery for the transaction of the business of the nation with the least possible friction and loss the government has been constantly increasing its efforts in these directions for the relief and permanent establishment of agriculture on a sound and equal basis with other business it is estimated that the value of the crops for this harvest year may reach 13 000 000 000 which is an increase of over 3 000 000 000 in three years it compares with 7 100 000 000 in 1913 arid if we make deduction from the figures of 1924 for the comparatively decreased value of the dollar the yield this year still exceeds 1913 in purchasing power by over 1 000 000 000 and in this interval there has been no increase in the number of farmers mostly by his own effort the farmer has decreased the cost of production a marked increase in the price of his products and some decrease in the price of his supplies has brought him about to a parity with the rest of the nation the crop area of this season is estimated at 370 000 000 acres which is a decline of 3 000 000 acres from last year and 6 000 000 acres from 1919 this has been a normal and natural application of economic laws which has placed agriculture on a foundation which is undeniably sound and beginning to be satisfactory a decrease in the world supply of wheat has resulted in a very large increase in the price of that commodity the position of all agricultural products indicates a better balanced supply but we can not yet conclude that agriculture is recovered from the effects of the war period or that it is permanently on a prosperous basis the cattle industry has not yet recovered and in some sections has been suffering from dry weather every effort must be made both by government activity and by private agencies to restore and maintain agriculture to a complete normal relationship with other industries it was on account of past depression and in spite of present more encouraging conditions that i have assembled an agricultural conference made up of those who are representative of this great industry in both its operating and economic sides everyone knows that the great need of the farmers is markets the country is not suffering on the side of production almost the entire difficulty is on the side of distribution this reaches back of course to unit costs and diversification and many allied subjects it is exceedingly intricate for our domestic and foreign trade transportation and banking and in fact our entire economic system are closely related to it in time for action at this session i hope to report to the congress such legislative remedies as the conference may recommend an appropriation should be made to defray their necessary expenses muscle shoals the production of nitrogen for plant food in peace and explosives in war is more and more important it is one of the chief sustaining elements of life it is estimated that soil exhaustion each year is represented by about 9 000 000 tons and replenishment by 5 450 000 tons the deficit of 3 550 000 tons is reported to represent the impairment of 118 000 000 acres of farm lands each year to meet these necessities the government has been developing a water power project at muscle shoals to be equipped to produce nitrogen for explosives and fertilizer it is my opinion that the support of agriculture is the chief problem to consider in connection with this property it could by no means supply the present needs for nitrogen but it would help and its development would encourage bringing other water powers into like use several offers have been made for the purchase of this property probably none of them represent final terms much costly experimentation is necessary to produce commercial nitrogen for that reason it is a field better suited to private enterprise than to government operation i should favor a sale of this property or long time lease tinder rigid guaranties of commercial nitrogen production at reasonable prices for agricultural use there would be a surplus of power for many years over any possibility of its application to a developing manufacture of nitrogen it may be found advantageous to dispose of the right to surplus power separately with such reservations as will allow its gradual withdrawal and application to nitrogen manufacture a subcommittee of the committees on agriculture should investigate this field and negotiate with prospective purchasers if no advantageous offer be made the development should continue and the plant should be dedicated primarily to the production of materials for the fertilization of the soil railways the railways during the past year have made still further progress in recuperation from the war with large rains in efficiency and ability expeditiously to handle the traffic of the country we have now passed through several periods of peak traffic without the car shortages which so frequently in the past have brought havoc to our agriculture and industries the condition of many of our great freight terminals is still one of difficulty and results in imposing large costs on the public for inward bound freight and on the railways for outward bound freight owing to the growth of our large cities and the great increase in the volume of traffic particularly in perishables the problem is not only difficult of solution but in some cases not wholly solvable by railway action alone in my message last year i emphasized the necessity for further legislation with a view to expediting the consolidation of our rail ways into larger systems the principle of government control of rates and profits now thoroughly imbedded in our governmental attitude toward natural monopolies such as the railways at once eliminates the need of competition by small units as a method of rate adjustment competition must be preserved as a stimulus to service but this will exist and can be increased tinder enlarged systems consequently the consolidation of the railways into larger units for the purpose of securing the substantial values to the public which will come from larger operation has been the logical conclusion of congress in its previous enactments and is also supported by the best opinion in the country such consolidation will assure not only a greater element of competition as to service but it will afford economy in operation greater stability in railway earnings and more economical financing it opens large possibilities of better equalization of rates between different classes of traffic so as to relieve undue burdens upon agricultural products and raw materials generally which are now not possible without ruin to small units owing to the lack of diversity of traffic it would also tend to equalize earnings in such fashion as to reduce the importance of section 15a at which criticism often misapplied has been directed a smaller number of units would offer less difficulties in labor adjustments and would contribute much to the solution of terminal difficulties the consolidations need to be carried out with due regard to public interest and to the rights and established life of various communities in our country it does not seem to me necessary that we endeavor to anticipate any final plan or adhere to an artificial and unchangeable project which shall stipulate a fixed number of systems but rather we ought to approach the problem with such a latitude of action that it can be worked out step by step in accordance with a comprehensive consideration of public interest whether the number of ultimate systems shall be more or less seems to me can only be determined by time and actual experience in the development of such consolidations those portions of the present law contemplating consolidations ore not sufficiently effective in producing expeditious action and need amplification of the authority of the interstate commerce commission particularly in affording a period for voluntary proposals to the commission and in supplying government pressure to secure action after the expiration of such a period there are other proposals before congress for amending the transportation acts one of these contemplates a revision of the method of valuation for rate making purposes to be followed by a renewed valuation of the railways the valuations instituted by the interstate commerce commission 10 years ago have not yet been completed they have cost the government an enormous sum and they have imposed great expenditure upon the railways most of which has in effect come out of the public in increased rates this work should not be abandoned or supplanted until its results are known and can be considered another matter before the congress is legislation affecting the labor sections of the transportation act much criticism has been directed at the workings of this section and experience has shown that some useful amendment could be made to these provisions it would be helpful if a plan could be adopted which while retaining the practice of systematic collective bargaining with conciliation voluntary arbitration of labor differences could also provide simplicity in relations and more direct local responsibility of employees and managers but such legislation will not meet the requirements of the situation unless it recognizes the principle that t e public has a right to the uninterrupted service of transportation and therefore a right to be heard when there is danger that the nation may suffer great injury through the interruption of operations because of labor disputes if these elements are not comprehended in proposed legislation it would be better to gain further experience with the present organization for dealing with these questions before undertaking a change shipping board the form of the organization of the shipping board was based originally on its functions as a semi judicial body in regulation of rates during the war it was loaded with enormous administrative duties it has been demonstrated time and again that this form of organization results in indecision division of opinion and administrative functions which make a wholly inadequate foundation for the conduct of a great business enterprise the first principle in securing the objective set out by congress in building up the american merchant marine upon the great trade routes and subsequently disposing of it into private operation can not proceed with effectiveness until the entire functions of the board are reorganized the immediate requirement is to transfer into the emergency fleet corporation the whole responsibility of operation of the fleet and other property leaving to the shipping board solely the duty of determining certain major policies which require deliberative action the procedure under section 28 of the merchant marine act has created great difficulty and threatened friction during the past 12 months its attempted application developed not only great opposition from exporters particularly as to burdens that may be imposed upon agricultural products but also great anxiety in the different seaports as to the effect upon their relative rate structures this trouble will certainly recur if action is attempted under this section it is uncertain in some of its terms and of great difficulty in interpretation it is my belief that action under this section should be suspended until the congress can reconsider the entire question in the light of the experience that has been developed since its enactment national elections nothing is so fundamental to the integrity of a republican form of government as honesty in all that relates to the conduct of elections i am of the opinion that the national laws governing the choice of members of the congress should be extended to include appropriate representation of the respective parties at the ballot box ant equality of representation on the various registration boards wherever they exist the judiciary the docket of the supreme court is becoming congested at the opening term last year it had 592 cases while this year it had 687 cases justice long delayed is justice refused unless the court be given power by preliminary and summary consideration to determine the importance of cases and by disposing of those which are not of public moment reserve its time for the more extended consideration of the remainder the congestion of the docket is likely to increase it is also desirable that supreme court should have power to improve and reform procedure in suits at law in the federal courts through the adoption of appropriate rules the judiciary committee of the senate has reported favorably upon two bills providing for these reforms which should have the immediate favorable consideration of the congress i further recommend that provision be made for the appointment of a commission to consist of two or three members of the federal judiciary and as many members of the bar to examine the present criminal code of procedure and recommend to the congress measures which may reform and expedite court procedure in the administration and enforcement of our criminal laws prison reform pending before the congress is a bill which has already passed one house providing for a reformatory to which could be committed first offenders and young men for the purpose of segregating them from contact with banned criminals and providing them with special training in order to reestablish in them the power to pursue a law abiding existence in the social and economic life of the nation this is a matter of so much importance as to warrant the early attention of the present session further provision should also be made for a like reason for a separate reformatory for women national police bureau representatives of the international police conference will bring to the attention of the congress a proposal for the establishment of a national police bureau such action would provide a central point for gathering compiling and later distributing to local police authorities much information which would be helpful in the prevention and detection of crime i believe this bureau is needed and i recommend favorable consideration of this proposal district of columbia welfare the welfare work of the district of columbia is administered by several different boards dealing with charities and various correctional efforts it would be an improvement if this work were consolidated and placed under the direction of a single commission french spoliation claims during the last session of the congress legislation was introduced looking to the payment of the remaining claims generally referred to as the french spoliation claims the congress has provided for the payment of many similar claims those that remain unpaid have been long pending the beneficiaries thereunder have every reason to expect payment these claims have been examined by the court of claims and their validity and amount determined the united states ought to pay its debts i recommend action by the congress which will permit of the payment of these remaining claims the wage earner two very important policies have been adopted by this country which while extending their benefits also in other directions have been of the utmost importance to the wage earners one of these is the protective tariff which enables our people to live according to a better standard and receive a better rate of compensation than any people any time anywhere on earth ever enjoyed this saves the american market for the products of the american workmen the other is a policy of more recent origin and seeks to shield our wage earners from the disastrous competition of a great influx of foreign peoples this has been done by the restrictive immigration law this saves the american job for the american workmen i should like to see the administrative features of this law rendered a little more humane for the purpose of permitting those already here a greater latitude in securing admission of members of their own families but i believe this law in principle is necessary and sound and destined to increase greatly the public welfare we must maintain our own economic position we must defend our own national integrity it is gratifying to report that the progress of industry the enormous increase in individual productivity through labor saving devices and the high rate of wages have all combined to furnish our people in general with such an abundance not only of the necessaries but of the conveniences of life that we are by a natural evolution solving our problems of economic and social justice the negro these developments have brought about a very remarkable improvement in the condition of the negro race gradually but surely with the almost universal sympathy of those among whom they live the colored people are working out their own destiny i firmly believe that it is better for all concerned that they should be cheerfully accorded their full constitutional rights that they should be protected from all of those impositions to which from their position they naturally fall a prey especially from the crime of lynching and that they should receive every encouragement to become full partakers in all the blessings of our common american citizenship civil service the merit system has long been recognized as the correct basis for employment in our civil service i believe that first second and third class postmasters and without covering in the present membership tile field force of prohibition enforcement should be brought within the classified service by statute law otherwise the executive order of one administration is changed by the executive order of another administration and little real progress is made whatever its defects the merit system is certainly to be preferred to the spoils system departmental reorganization one way to save public money would be to pass the pending bill for the reorganization of the various departments this project has been pending for some time and has had the most careful consideration of experts and the thorough study of a special congressional committee this legislation is vital as a companion piece to the budget law legal authority for a thorough reorganization of the federal structure with some latitude of action to the executive in the rearrangement of secondary functions would make for continuing economy in the shift of government activities which must follow every change in a developing country beyond this many of the independent agencies of the government must be placed under responsible cabinet officials if we are to have safeguards of efficiency economy and probity army and navy little has developed in relation to our national defense which needs special attention progress is constantly being made in air navigation and requires encouragement and development army aviators have made a successful trip around the world for which i recommend suitable recognition through provisions for promotion compensation and retirement under the direction of the navy a new zeppelin has been successfully brought from europe across the atlantic to our own country due to the efficient supervision of the secretary of war the army of the united states has been organized with a small body of regulars and a moderate national guard and reserve the defense test of september 12 demonstrated the efficiency of the operating plans these methods and operations are well worthy of congressional support under the limitation of armaments treaty a large saving in outlay and a considerable decrease in maintenance of the navy has been accomplished we should maintain the policy of constantly working toward the full treaty strength of the navy careful investigation is being made in this department of the relative importance of aircraft surface and submarine vessels in order that we may not fail to take advantage of all modern improvements for our national defense a special commission also is investigating the problem of petroleum oil for the navy considering the best policy to insure the future supply of fuel oil and prevent the threatened drainage of naval oil reserves legislative action is required to carry on experiments in oil shale reduction as large deposits of this type have been set aside for the use of the navy we have been constantly besought to engage in competitive armaments frequent reports will reach us of the magnitude of the military equipment of other nations we shall do well to be little impressed by such reports or such actions any nation undertaking to maintain a military establishment with aggressive and imperialistic designs will find itself severely handicapped in the economic development of the world i believe thoroughly in the army and navy in adequate defense and preparation but i am opposed to any policy of competition in building and maintaining land or sea armaments our country has definitely relinquished the old standard of dealing with other countries by terror and force and is definitely committed to the new standard of dealing with them through friendship and understanding this new policy should be constantly kept in mind by the guiding forces of the army and navy by the congress and by the country at large i believe it holds a promise of great benefit to humanity i shall resist any attempt to resort to the old methods and the old standards i am especially solicitous that foreign nations should comprehend the candor and sincerity with which we have adopted this position while we propose to maintain defensive and supplementary police forces by land and sea and to train them through inspections and maneuvers upon appropriate occasions in order to maintain their efficiency i wish every other nation to understand that this does not express any unfriendliness or convey any hostile intent i want the armed forces of america to be considered by all peoples not as enemies but as friends as the contribution which is made by this country for the maintenance of the peace and security of the world veterans with the authorization for general hospitalization of the veterans of all wars provided during the present year the care and treatment of those who have served their country in time of peril and the attitude of the government toward them is not now so much one of needed legislation as one of careful generous and humane administration it will ever be recognized that their welfare is of the first concern and always entitled to the most solicitous consideration oil the part of their fellow citizens they are organized in various associations of which the chief and most representative is the american legion through its officers the legion will present to the congress numerous suggestions for legislation they cover such a wide variety of subjects that it is impossible to discuss them within the scope of this message with many of the proposals i join in hearty approval and commend them all to the sympathetic investigation and consideration of the congress foreign relations at no period in the past 12 years have our foreign relations been in such a satisfactory condition as they are at the present time our actions in the recent months have greatly strengthened the american policy of permanent peace with independence the attitude which our government took and maintained toward an adjustment of european reparations by pointing out that it wits not a political but a business problem has demonstrated its wisdom by its actual results we desire to see europe restored that it may resume its productivity in the increase of industry and its support in the advance of civilization we look with great gratification at the hopeful prospect of recuperation in europe through the dawes plan such assistance as can be given through the action of the public authorities and of our private citizens through friendly counsel and cooperation and through economic and financial support not for any warlike effort but for reproductive enterprise not to provide means for unsound government financing but to establish sound business administration should be unhesitatingly provided ultimately nations like individuals can not depend upon each other but must depend upon themselves each one must work out its own salvation we have every desire to help but with all our resources we are powerless to save unless our efforts meet with a constructive response the situation in our own country and all over the world is one chat can be improved only by bard work and self denial it is necessary to reduce expenditures increase savings and liquidate debts it is in this direction that there lies the greatest hope of domestic tranquility and international peace our own country ought to finish the leading example in this effort our past adherence to this policy our constant refusal to maintain a military establishment that could be thought to menace the security of others our honorable dealings with other nations whether great or small has left us in the almost constant enjoyment of peace it is not necessary to stress the general desire of all the people of this country for the promotion of peace it is the leading principle of all our foreign relations we have on every occasion tried to cooperate to this end in all ways that were consistent with our proper independence and our traditional policies it will be my constant effort to maintain these principles and to reinforce them by all appropriate agreements and treaties while we desire always to cooperate and to help we are equally determined to be independent and free right and truth and justice and humanitarian efforts will have the moral support of this country all over the world but we do not wish to become involved in the political controversies of others nor is the country disposed to become a member of the league of nations or to assume the obligations imposed by its covenant international court america has been one of the foremost nations in advocating tribunals for the settlement of international disputes of a justiciable character our representatives took a leading in those conferences which resulted in the establishment of e ague tribunal and later in providing for a permanent court of international justice i believe it would be for the advantage of this country and helpful to the stability of other nations for us to adhere to the protocol establishing that court upon the conditions stated in the recommendation which is now before the senate and further that our country shall not be bound by advisory opinions which may be rendered by the court upon questions which we have not voluntarily submitted for its judgment this court would provide a practical and convenient tribunal before which we could go voluntarily but to which we could not be summoned for a determination of justiciable questions when they fail to be resolved by diplomatic negotiations disarmament conference many times i have expressed my desire to see the work of the washington conference on limitation of armaments appropriately supplemented by further agreements for a further reduction m for the purpose of diminishing the menace and waste of the competition in preparing instruments of international war it has been and is my expectation that we might hopefully approach other great powers for further conference on this subject as soon as the carrying out of the present reparation plan as the established and settled policy of europe has created a favorable opportunity but on account of proposals which have already been made by other governments for a european conference it will be necessary to wait to see what the outcome of their actions may be i should not wish to propose or have representatives attend a conference which would contemplate commitments opposed to the freedom of action we desire to maintain unimpaired with respect to our purely domestic policies international law our country should also support efforts which are being made toward the codification of international law we can look more hopefully in the first instance for research and studies that are likely to be productive of results to a cooperation among representatives of the bar and members of international law institutes and societies than to a conference of those who are technically representative of their respective governments although when projects have been developed they must go to the governments for their approval these expert professional studies are going on in certain quarters and should have our constant encouragement and approval outlaw of war much interest has of late been manifested in this country in the discussion of various proposals to outlaw aggressive war i look with great sympathy upon the examination of this subject it is in harmony with the traditional policy of our country which is against aggressive war and for the maintenance of permanent and honorable peace while as i have said we must safeguard our liberty to deal according to our own judgment with our domestic policies we can not fail to view with sympathetic interest all progress to this desired end or carefully to study the measures that may be proposed to attain it latin america while we are desirous of promoting peace in every quarter of the globe we have a special interest in the peace of this hemisphere it is our constant desire that all causes of dispute in this area may be tranquilly and satisfactorily adjusted along with our desire for peace is the earnest hope for the increased prosperity of our sister republics of latin america and our constant purpose to promote cooperation with them which may be mutually beneficial and always inspired by the most cordial friendships foreign debts about 12 000 000 000 is due to our government from abroad mostly from european governments great britain finland hungary lithuania and poland have negotiated settlements amounting close to 5 000 000 000 this represents the funding of over 42 per cent of the debt since the creation of the special foreign debt commission as the life of this commission is about to expire its term should be extended i am opposed to the cancellation of these debts and believe it for the best welfare of the world that they should be liquidated and paid as fast as possible i do not favor oppressive measures but unless money that is borrowed is repaid credit can not be secured in time of necessity and there exists besides a moral obligation which our country can not ignore and no other country can evade terms and conditions may have to conform to differences in the financial abilities of the countries concerned but the principle that each country should meet its obligation admits of no differences and is of universal application it is axiomatic that our country can not stand still it would seem to be perfectly plain from recent events that it is determined to go forward but it wants no pretenses it wants no vagaries it is determined to advance in an orderly sound and common sense way it does not propose to abandon the theory of the declaration that the people have inalienable rights which no majority and no power of government can destroy it does not propose to abandon the practice of the constitution that provides for the protection of these rights it believes that within these limitations which are imposed not by the fiat of man but by the law of the creator self government is just and wise it is convinced that it will be impossible for the people to provide their own government unless they continue to own their own property these are the very foundations of america on them has been erected a government of freedom and equality of justice and mercy of education and charity living under it and supporting it the people have come into great possessions on the material and spiritual sides of life i want to continue in this direction i know that the congress shares with me that desire i want our institutions to be more and more expressive of these principles i want the people of all the earth to see in the american flag the symbol of a government which intends no oppression at home and no aggression abroad which in the spirit of a common brotherhood provides assistance in time of distress

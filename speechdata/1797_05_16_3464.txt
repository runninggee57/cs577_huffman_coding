the personal inconveniences to the members of the senate and of the house of representatives in leaving their families and private affairs at this season of the year are so obvious that i the more regret the extraordinary occasion which has rendered the convention of congress indispensable it would have afforded me the highest satisfaction to have been able to congratulate you on a restoration of peace to the nations of europe whose animosities have endangered our tranquillity but we have still abundant cause of gratitude to the supreme dispenser of national blessings for general health and promising seasons for domestic and social happiness for the rapid progress and ample acquisitions of industry through extensive territories for civil political and religious liberty while other states are desolated with foreign war or convulsed with intestine divisions the united states present the pleasing prospect of a nation governed by mild and equal laws generally satisfied with the possession of the rights neither envying the advantages nor fearing the power of other nations solicitous only for the maintenance of order and justice and the preservation of liberty increasing daily in their attachment to a system of government in proportion to their experience of its utility yielding a ready and general obedience to laws flowing from the reason and resting on the only solid foundation the affections of the people it is with extreme regret that i shall be obliged to turn your thoughts to other circumstances which admonish us that some of these felicities may not be lasting but if the tide of our prosperity is full and a reflux commencing a vigilant circumspection becomes us that we may meet our reverses with fortitude and extricate ourselves from their consequences with all the skill we possess and all the efforts in our power in giving to congress information of the state of the union and recommending to their consideration such measures as appear to me to be necessary or expedient according to my constitutional duty the causes and the objects of the present extraordinary session will be explained after the president of the united states received information that the french government had expressed serious discontents at some proceedings of the government of these states said to affect the interests of france he thought it expedient to send to that country a new minister fully instructed to enter on such amicable discussions and to give such candid explanations as might happily remove the discontents and suspicions of the french government and vindicate the conduct of the united states for this purpose he selected from among his fellow citizens a character whose integrity talents experience and services had placed him in the rank of the most esteemed and respected in the nation the direct object of his mission was expressed in his letter of credence to the french republic being to maintain that good understanding which from the commencement of the alliance had subsisted between the two nations and to efface unfavorable impressions banish suspicions and restore that cordiality which was at once the evidence and pledge of a friendly union and his instructions were to the same effect faithfully to represent the disposition of the government and people of the united states their disposition being 1 to remove jealousies and obviate complaints by shewing that they were groundless to restore that mutual confidence which had been so unfortunately and injuriously impaired and to explain the relative interests of both countries and the real sentiments of his own a minister thus specially commissioned it was expected would have proved the instrument of restoring mutual confidence between the two republics the first step of the french government corresponded with that expectation a few days before his arrival at paris the french minister of foreign relations informed the american minister then resident at paris of the formalities to be observed by himself in taking leave and by his successor preparatory to his reception these formalities they observed and on the 9th of december presented officially to the minister of foreign relations the one a copy of his letters of recall the other a copy of his letters of credence these were laid before the executive directory two days afterwards the minister of foreign relations informed the recalled american minister that the executive directory had determined not to receive another minister plenipotentiary from the united states until after the redress of grievances demanded of the american government and which the french republic had a right to expect from it the american minister immediately endeavored to ascertain whether by refusing to receive him it was intended that he should retire from the territories of the french republic and verbal answers were given that such was the intention of the directory for his own justification he desired a written answer but obtained none until toward the last of january when receiving notice in writing to quit the territories of the republic he proceeded to amsterdam where he proposed to wait for instruction from this government during his residence at paris cards of hospitality were refused him and he was threatened with being subjected to the jurisdiction of the minister of police but with becoming firmness he insisted on the protection of the law of nations due to him as the known minister of a foreign power you will derive further information from his dispatches which will be laid before you as it is often necessary that nations should treat for the mutual advantage of their affairs and especially to accommodate and terminate differences and as they can treat only by ministers the right of embassy is well known and established by the law and usage of nations the refusal on the part of france to receive our minister is then the denial of a right but the receive him until we have acceded to their demands without discussion and without investigation is to treat us neither as allies nor as friends nor as a sovereign state with this conduct of the french government it will be proper to take into view the public audience given to the late minister of the united states on his taking leave of the executive directory the speech of the president discloses sentiments more alarming than the refusal of a minister because more dangerous to our independence and union and at the same time studiously marked with indignities toward the government of the united states it evinces a disposition to separate the people of the united states from the government to persuade them that they have different affections principles and interests from those of their fellow citizens whom they themselves have chosen to manage their common concerns and thus to produce divisions fatal to our peace such attempts ought to be repelled with a decision which shall convince france and the world that we are not a degraded people humiliated under a colonial spirit of fear and sense of inferiority fitted to be the miserable instruments of foreign influence and regardless of national honor character and interest i should have been happy to have thrown a veil over these transactions if it had been possible to conceal them but they have passed on the great theater of the world in the face of all europe and america and with such circumstances of publicity and solemnity that they can not be disguised and will not soon be forgotten they have inflicted a wound in the american breast it is my sincere desire however that it may be healed it is my sincere desire and in this i presume i concur with you and with our constituents to preserve peace and friendship with all nations and believing that neither the honor nor the interest of the united states absolutely forbid the repetition of advances for securing these desirable objects with france i shall institute a fresh attempt at negotiation and shall not fail to promote and accelerate an accommodation on terms compatible with the rights duties interests and honor of the nation if we have committed errors and these can be demonstrated we shall be willing on conviction to redress them and equal measures of justice we have a right to expect from france and every other nation the diplomatic intercourse between the united states and france being at present suspended the government has no means of obtaining official information from that country nevertheless there is reason to believe that the executive directory passed a decree on the 2nd of march last contravening in part the treaty of amity and commerce of 1778 injurious to our lawful commerce and endangering the lives of our citizens a copy of this decree will be laid before you while we are endeavoring to adjust all our differences with france by amicable negotiation the progress of the war in europe the depredations on our commerce the personal injuries to our citizens and the general complexion of affairs render it my indispensable duty to recommend to your consideration effectual measures of defense the commerce of the united states has become an interesting object of attention whether we consider it in relation to the wealth and finances or the strength and resources of the nation with a sea coast of near 2000 miles in extent opening a wide field for fisheries navigation and commerce a great portion of our citizens naturally apply their industry and enterprise to these objects any serious and permanent injury to commerce would not fail to produce the most embarrassing disorders to prevent it from being undermined and destroyed it is essential that it receive an adequate protection the naval establishment must occur to every man who considers the injuries committed on our commerce the insults offered to our citizens and the description of vessels by which these abuses have been practiced as the sufferings of our mercantile and sea faring citizens can not be ascribed to the omission of duties demandable considering the neutral situation of our country they are to be attributed to the hope of impunity arising from a supposed inability on our part to afford protection to resist the consequences of such impressions on the minds of foreign nations and to guard against the degradation and servility which they must finally stamp on the american character is an important duty of government a naval power next to the militia is the natural defense of the united states the experience of the last war would be sufficient to shew that a moderate naval force such as would be easily within the present abilities of the union would have been sufficient to have baffled many formidable transportations of troops from one state to another which were then practiced our sea coasts from their great extent are more easily annoyed and more easily defended by a naval force than any other with all the materials our country abounds in skill our naval architects and navigators are equal to any and commanders and sea men will not be wanting but although the establishment of a permanent system of naval defense appears to be requisite i am sensible it can not be formed so speedily and extensively as the present crisis demands hitherto i have thought proper to prevent the sailing of armed vessels except on voyages to the east indies where general usage and the danger from pirates appeared to render the permission proper yet the restriction has originated solely from a wish to prevent collisions with the powers at war contravening the act of congress of june 1794 and not from any doubt entertained by me of the policy and propriety of permitting our vessels to employ means of defense while engaged in a lawful foreign commerce it remains for congress to prescribe such regulations as will enable our sea faring citizens to defend themselves against violations of the law of nations and at the same time restrain them from committing acts of hostility against the powers at war in addition to this voluntary provision for defense by individual citizens it appears to me necessary to equip the frigates and provide other vessels of inferior force to take under convoy such merchant vessels as shall remain unarmed the greater part of the cruisers whose depredations have been most injurious have been built and some of them partially equipped in the united states although an effectual remedy may be attended with difficulty yet i have thought it my duty to present the subject generally to your consideration if a mode can be devised by the wisdom of congress to prevent the resources of the united states from being converted into the means of annoying our trade a great evil will be prevented with the same view i think it proper to mention that some of our citizens resident abroad have fitted out privateers and others have voluntarily taken the command or entered on board of them and committed spoliations on the commerce of the united states such unnatural and iniquitous practices can be restrained only by severe punishments but besides a protection of our commerce on the seas i think it highly necessary to protect it at home where it is collected in our most important ports the distance of the united states from europe and the well known promptitude ardor and courage of the people in defense of their country happily diminish the probability of invasion nevertheless to guard against sudden and predatory incursions the situation of some of our principal sea ports demands your consideration and as our country is vulnerable in other interests besides those of its commerce you will seriously deliberate whether the means of general defense ought not to be increased by an addition to the regular artillery and cavalry and by arrangements for forming a provisional army with the same view and as a measure which even in a time of universal peace ought not to be neglected i recommend to your consideration a revision of the laws for organizing arming and disciplining the militia to render that natural and safe defense of the country efficacious although it is very true that we ought not to involve ourselves in the political system of europe but to keep ourselves always distinct and separate from it if we can yet to effect this separation early punctual and continual information of the current chain of events and of the political projects in contemplation is no less necessary than if we were directly concerned in them it is necessary in order to the discovery of the efforts made to draw us into the vortex in season to make preparations against them however we may consider ourselves the maritime and commercial powers of the world will consider the united states of america as forming a weight in that balance of power in europe which never can be forgotten or neglected it would not only be against our interest but it would be doing wrong to half of europe at least if we should voluntarily throw ourselves into either scale it is a natural policy for a nation that studies to be neutral to consult with other nations engaged in the same studies and pursuits at the same time that measures might be pursued with this view our treaties with prussia and sweden one of which is expired and the other near expiring might be renewed gentlemen of the house of representatives it is particularly your province to consider the state of the public finances and to adopt such measures respecting them as exigencies shall be found to require the preservation of public credit the regular extinguishment of the public debt and a provision of funds to defray any extraordinary expenses will of course call for your serious attention although the imposition of new burthens can not be in itself agreeable yet there is no ground to doubt that the american people will expect from you such measures as their actual engagements their present security and future interests demand gentlemen of the senate and gentlemen of the house of representatives the present situation of our country imposes an obligation on all the departments of government to adopt an explicit and decided conduct in my situation an exposition of the principles by which my administration will be governed ought not be omitted it is impossible to conceal from ourselves or the world what has been before observed that endeavors have been employed to foster and establish a division between the government and people of the united states to investigate the causes which have encouraged this attempt is not necessary but to repel by decided and united councils insinuations so derogatory to the honor and aggressions so dangerous to the constitution union and even independence of the nation is an indispensable duty it must not be permitted to be doubted whether the people of the united states will support the government established by their voluntary consent and appointed by their free choice or whether by surrendering themselves to the direction of foreign and domestic factions in opposition to their own government they will forfeit the honorable station they have hitherto maintained for myself having never been indifferent to what concerned the interests of my country devoted the best part of my life to obtain and support its independence and constantly witnessed the patriotism fidelity and perseverance of my fellow citizens on the most trying occasions it is not for me to hesitate or abandon a cause in which my heart has been so long engaged convinced that the conduct of the government has been just and impartial to foreign nations that those internal regulations which have been established by law for the preservation of peace are in their nature proper and that they have been fairly executed nothing will ever be done by me to impair the national engagements to innovate upon principles which have been so deliberately and uprightly established or to surrender in any manner the rights of the government to enable me to maintain this declaration i rely under god with entire confidence on the firm and enlightened support of the national legislature and upon the virtue and patriotism of my fellow citizens

mr speaker mr president members of the congress it is with a heavy heart that i stand before you my friends and colleagues in the congress of the united states only yesterday we laid to rest the mortal remains of our beloved president franklin delano roosevelt at a time like this words are inadequate the most eloquent tribute would be a reverent silence yet in this decisive hour when world events are moving so rapidly our silence might be misunderstood and might give comfort to our enemies in his infinite wisdom almighty god has seen fit to take from us a great man who loved and was beloved by all humanity no man could possibly fill the tremendous void left by the passing of that noble soul no words can ease the aching hearts of untold millions of every race creed and color the world knows it has lost a heroic champion of justice and freedom tragic fate has thrust upon us grave responsibilities we must carry on our departed leader never looked backward he looked forward and moved forward that is what he would want us to do that is what america will do so much blood has already been shed for the ideals which we cherish and for which franklin delano roosevelt lived and died that we dare not permit even a momentary pause in the hard fight for victory today the entire world is looking to america for enlightened leadership to peace and progress such a leadership requires vision courage and tolerance it can be provided only by a united nation deeply devoted to the highest ideals with great humility i call upon all americans to help me keep our nation united in defense of those ideals which have been so eloquently proclaimed by franklin roosevelt i want in turn to assure my fellow americans and all of those who love peace and liberty throughout the world that i will support and defend those ideals with all my strength and all my heart that is my duty and i shall not shirk it so that there can be no possible misunderstanding both germany and japan can be certain beyond any shadow of a doubt that america will continue the fight for freedom until no vestige of resistance remains we are deeply conscious of the fact that much hard fighting is still ahead of us having to pay such a heavy price to make complete victory certain america will never become a party to any plan for partial victory to settle for merely another temporary respite would surely jeopardize the future security of all the world our demand has been and it remains unconditional surrender we will not traffic with the breakers of the peace on the terms of the peace the responsibility for making of the peace and it is a very grave responsibility must rest with the defenders of the peace we are not unconscious of the dictates of humanity we do not wish to see unnecessary or unjustified suffering but the laws of god and of man have been violated and the guilty must not go unpunished nothing shall shake our determination to punish the war criminals even though we must pursue them to the ends of the earth lasting peace can never be secured if we permit our dangerous opponents to plot future wars with impunity at any mountain retreat however distant in this shrinking world it is futile to seek safety behind geographical barriers real security will be found only in law and in justice here in america we have labored long and hard to achieve a social order worthy of our great heritage in our time tremendous progress has been made toward a really democratic way of life let me assure the forward looking people of america that there will be no relaxation in our efforts to improve the lot of the common people in the difficult days ahead unquestionably we shall face problems of staggering proportions however with the faith of our fathers in our hearts we do not fear the future on the battlefields we have frequently faced overwhelming odds and won at home americans will not be less resolute we shall never cease our struggle to preserve and maintain our american way of life at this moment america along with her brave allies is paying again a heavy price for the defense of our freedom with characteristic energy we are assisting in the liberation of entire nations gradually the shackles of slavery are being broken by the forces of freedom all of us are praying for a speedy victory every day peace is delayed costs a terrible toll the armies of liberation today are bringing to an end hitler s ghastly threat to dominate the world tokyo rocks under the weight of our bombs the grand strategy of the united nations war has been determined due in no small measure to the vision of our departed commander in chief we are now carrying out our part of that strategy under the able direction of admiral leahy general marshall admiral king general arnold general eisenhower admiral nimitz and general macarthur i want the entire world to know that this direction must and will remain unchanged and unhampered our debt to the heroic men and valiant women in the service of our country can never be repaid they have earned our undying gratitude america will never forget their sacrifices because of these sacrifices the dawn of justice and freedom throughout the world slowly casts its gleam across the horizon our forefathers came to our rugged shores in search of religious tolerance political freedom and economic opportunity for those fundamental rights they risked their lives we well know today that such rights can be preserved only by constant vigilance the eternal price of liberty within an hour after i took the oath of office i announced that the san francisco conference would proceed we will face the problems of peace with the same courage that we have faced and mastered the problems of war in the memory of those who have made the supreme sacrifice in the memory of our fallen president we shall not fail it is not enough to yearn for peace we must work and if necessary fight for it the task of creating a sound international organization is complicated and difficult yet without such organization the rights of man on earth cannot be protected machinery for the just settlement of international differences must be found without such machinery the entire world will have to remain an armed camp the world will be doomed to deadly conflict devoid of hope for real peace fortunately people have retained hope for a durable peace thoughtful people have always had faith that ultimately justice must triumph past experience surely indicates that without justice an enduring peace becomes impossible in bitter despair some people have come to believe that wars are inevitable with tragic fatalism they insist that wars have always been of necessity and of necessity wars always will be to such defeatism men and women of good will must not and can not yield the outlook for humanity is not so hopeless during the dark hours of this horrible war entire nations were kept going by something intangible hope when warned that abject submission offered the only salvation against overwhelming power hope showed the way to victory hope has become the secret weapon of the forces of liberation aggressors could not dominate the human mind as long as hope remains the spirit of man will never be crushed but hope alone was not and is not sufficient to avert war we must not only have hope but we must have faith enough to work with other peace loving nations to maintain the peace hope was not enough to beat back the aggressors as long as the peace loving nations were unwilling to come to each other s defense the aggressors were beaten back only when the peace loving nations united to defend themselves if wars in the future are to be prevented the nations must be united in their determination to keep the peace under law nothing is more essential to the future peace of the world than continued cooperation of the nations which had to muster the force necessary to defeat the conspiracy of the axis powers to dominate the world while these great states have a special responsibility to enforce the peace their responsibility is based upon the obligations resting upon all states large and small not to use force in international relations except in the defense of law the responsibility of the great states is to serve and not to dominate the world to build a foundation of enduring peace we must not only work in harmony with our friends abroad but we must have the united support of our own people even the most experienced pilot cannot bring a ship safely into harbor unless he has the full cooperation of the crew for the benefit of all every individual must do his duty i appeal to every american regardless of party race creed or color to support our efforts to build a strong and lasting united nations organization you the members of the congress surely know how i feel only with your help can i hope to complete one of the greatest tasks ever assigned to a public servant with divine guidance and your help we will find the new passage to a far better world a kindly and friendly world with just and lasting peace with confidence i am depending upon all of you to destroy greedy tyrants with dreams of world domination we cannot continue in successive generations to sacrifice our finest youth in the name of human decency and civilization a more rational method of deciding national differences must and will be found america must assist suffering humanity back along the path of peaceful progress this will require time and tolerance we shall need also an abiding faith in the people the kind of faith and courage which franklin delano roosevelt always had today america has become one of the most powerful forces for good on earth we must keep it so we have achieved a world leadership which does not depend solely upon our military and naval might we have learned to fight with other nations in common defense of our freedom we must now learn to live with other nations for our mutual good we must learn to trade more with other nations so that there may be for our mutual advantage increased production increased employment and better standards of living throughout the world may we americans all live up to our glorious heritage in that way america may well lead the world to peace and prosperity at this moment i have in my heart a prayer as i have assumed my heavy duties i humbly pray almighty god in the words of king solomon give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that i may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great a people i ask only to be a good and faithful servant of my lord and my people

the president thank you all very much welcome to the white house this ceremony and the treaty we re signing today are both excellent examples of the rewards of patience it was over 6 years ago november 18 1981 that i first proposed what would come to be called the zero option it was a simple proposal one might say disarmingly simple unlike treaties in the past it didn t simply codify the status quo or a new arms buildup it didn t simply talk of controlling an arms race for the first time in history the language of arms control was replaced by arms reduction in this case the complete elimination of an entire class of u s and soviet nuclear missiles of course this required a dramatic shift in thinking and it took conventional wisdom some time to catch up reaction to say the least was mixed to some the zero option was impossibly visionary and unrealistic to others merely a propaganda ploy well with patience determination and commitment we ve made this impossible vision a reality general secretary gorbachev i m sure you re familiar with ivan krylov s famous tale about the swan the crawfish and the pike it seems that once upon a time these three were trying to move a wagonload together they hitched and harnessed themselves to the wagon it wasn t very heavy but no matter how hard they worked the wagon just wouldn t move you see the swan was flying upward the crawfish kept crawling backward the pike kept making for the water the end result was that they got nowhere and the wagon is still there to this day well strong and fundamental moral differences continue to exist between our nations but today on this vital issue at least we ve seen what can be accomplished when we pull together the numbers alone demonstrate the value of this agreement on the soviet side over 1 500 deployed warheads will be removed and all ground launched intermediate range missiles including the ss 20 s will be destroyed on our side our entire complement of pershing ii and ground launched cruise missiles with some 400 deployed warheads will all be destroyed additional backup missiles on both sides will also be destroyed but the importance of this treaty transcends numbers we have listened to the wisdom in an old russian maxim and i m sure you re familiar with it mr general secretary though my pronunciation may give you difficulty the maxim is dovorey no provorey trust but verify the general secretary you repeat that at every meeting the president i like it this agreement contains the most stringent verification regime in history including provisions for inspection teams actually residing in each other s territory and several other forms of on site inspection as well this treaty protects the interests of america s friends and allies it also embodies another important principle the need for glasnost a greater openness in military programs and forces we can only hope that this history making agreement will not be an end in itself but the beginning of a working relationship that will enable us to tackle the other urgent issues before us strategic offensive nuclear weapons the balance of conventional forces in europe the destructive and tragic regional conflicts that beset so many parts of our globe and respect for the human and natural rights god has granted to all men to all here who have worked so hard to make this vision a reality thank you and congratulations above all to ambassadors glitman and obukhov to quote another russian proverb as you can see i m becoming quite an expert in russian proverbs the harvest comes more from sweat than from the dew so i m going to propose to general secretary gorbachev that we issue one last instruction to you get some well deserved rest the general secretary we re not going to do that the president well now mr general secretary would you like to say a few words before we sign the treaty the general secretary mr president ladies and gentlemen comrades succeeding generations will hand down their verdict on the importance of the event which we are about to witness but i will venture to say that what we are going to do the signing of the first ever agreement eliminating nuclear weapons has a universal significance for mankind both from the standpoint of world politics and from the standpoint of humanism for everyone and above all for our two great powers the treaty whose text is on this table offers a big chance at last to get onto the road leading away from the threat of catastrophe it is our duty to take full advantage of that chance and move together toward a nuclear free world which holds out for our children and grandchildren and for their children and grandchildren the promise of a fulfilling and happy life without fear and without a senseless waste of resources on weapons of destruction we can he proud of planting this sapling which may one day grow into a mighty tree of peace but it is probably still too early to bestow laurels upon each other as the great american poet and philosopher ralph waldo emerson said the reward of a thing well done is to have done it so let us reward ourselves by getting down to business we have covered a 7 year long road replete with intense work and debate one last step towards this table and the treaty will be signed may december 8 1987 become a date that will be inscribed in the history books a date that will mark the watershed separating the era of a mounting risk of nuclear war from the era of a demilitarization of human life

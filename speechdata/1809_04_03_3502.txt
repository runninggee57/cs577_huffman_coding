returning to the scenes of my birth and early life to the society of those with whom i was raised and who have been ever dear to me i receive fellow citizens and neighbors with inexpressible pleasure the cordial welcome you are so good as to give me long absent on duties which the history of a wonderful era made incumbent on those called to them the pomp the turmoil the bustle and splendor of office have drawn but deeper sighs for the tranquil and irresponsible occupations of private life for the enjoyment of an affectionate intercourse with you my neighbors and friends and the endearments of family love which nature has given us all as the sweetener of every hour for these i gladly lay down the distressing burthen of power and seek with my fellow citizens repose and safety under the watchful cares the labors and perplexities of younger and abler minds the anxieties you express to administer to my happiness do of themselves confer that happiness and the measure will be complete if my endeavors to fulfill my duties in the several public stations to which i have been called have obtained for me the approbation of my country the part which i have acted on the theatre of public life has been before them and to their sentence i submit it but the testimony of my native country of the individuals who have known me in private life to my conduct in its various duties and relations is the more grateful as proceeding from eye witnesses and observers from triers of the vicinage of you then my neighbors i may ask in the face of the world whose ox have i taken or whom have defrauded whom have i oppressed or of whose hand have i received a bribe to blind mine eyes therewith on your verdict i rest with conscious security your wishes for my happiness are received with just sensibility and i offer sincere prayers for your own welfare and prosperity

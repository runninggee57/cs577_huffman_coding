and now friends and countrymen if the wise and learned philosophers of the elder world the first observers of nutation and aberration the discoverers of maddening ether and invisible planets the inventors of congreve rockets and shrapnel shells should find their hearts disposed to enquire what has america done for the benefit of mankind let our answer be this america with the same voice which spoke herself into existence as a nation proclaimed to mankind the inextinguishable rights of human nature and the only lawful foundations of government america in the assembly of nations since her admission among them has invariably though often fruitlessly held forth to them the hand of honest friendship of equal freedom of generous reciprocity she has uniformly spoken among them though often to heedless and often to disdainful ears the language of equal liberty of equal justice and of equal rights she has in the lapse of nearly half a century without a single exception respected the independence of other nations while asserting and maintaining her own she has abstained from interference in the concerns of others even when conflict has been for principles to which she clings as to the last vital drop that visits the heart she has seen that probably for centuries to come all the contests of that aceldama the european world will be contests of inveterate power and emerging right wherever the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled there will her heart her benedictions and her prayers be but she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy she is the well wisher to the freedom and independence of all she is the champion and vindicator only of her own she will commend the general cause by the countenance of her voice and the benignant sympathy of her example she well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than her own were they even the banners of foreign independence she would involve herself beyond the power of extrication in all the wars of interest and intrigue of individual avarice envy and ambition which assume the colors and usurp the standard of freedom the fundamental maxims of her policy would insensibly change from liberty to force she might become the dictatress of the world she would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit america s glory is not dominion but liberty her march is the march of the mind she has a spear and a shield but the motto upon her shield is freedom independence peace this has been her declaration this has been as far as her necessary intercourse with the rest of mankind would permit her practice

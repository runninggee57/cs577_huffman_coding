good evening my fellow citizens i returned this morning from a week long trip to europe and i want to report to you on that trip in full it was in every sense an unforgettable experience the people of paris of vienna of london were generous in their greeting they were heartwarming in their hospitality and their graciousness to my wife is particularly appreciated we knew of course that the crowds and the shouts were meant in large measure for the country that we represented which is regarded as the chief defender of freedom equally memorable was the pageantry of european history and their culture that is very much a part of any ceremonial reception to lay a wreath at the arc de triomphe to dine at versailles and schonbrunn palace and with the queen of england these are the colorful memories that will remain with us for many years to come each of the three cities that we visited paris vienna and london have existed for many centuries and each serves as a reminder that the western civilization that we seek to preserve has flowered over many years and has defended itself over many centuries but this was not a ceremonial trip two aims of american foreign policy above all others were the reason for the trip the unity of the free world whose strength is the security of us all and the eventual achievement of a lasting peace my trip was devoted to the advancement of these two aims to strengthen the unity of the west our journey opened in paris and closed in london my talks with general de gaulle were profoundly encouraging to me certain differences in our attitudes on one or another problem became insignificant in view of our common commitment to defend freedom our alliance i believe became more secure the friendship of our nation i hope with theirs became firmer and the relations between the two of us who bear responsibility became closer and i hope were marked by confidence i found general de gaulle far more interested in our frankly stating our position whether or not it was his own than in appearing to agree with him when we do not but he knows full well the true meaning of an alliance he is after all the only major leader of world war ii who still occupies a position of great responsibility his life has been one of unusual dedication he is a man of extraordinary personal character symbolizing the new strength and the historic grandeur of france throughout our discussions he took the long view of france and the world at large i found him a wise counselor for the future and an informative guide to the history that he has helped to make thus we had a valuable meeting i believe that certain doubts and suspicions that might have come up in a long time i believe were removed on both sides problems which proved to be not of substance but of wording or procedure were cleared away no question however sensitive was avoided no area of interest was ignored and the conclusions that we reached will be important for the future in our agreement on defending berlin on working to improve the defenses of europe on aiding the economic and political independence of the underdeveloped world including latin america on spurring european economic unity on concluding successfully the conference on laos and on closer consultations and solidarity in the western alliance general de gaulle could not have been more cordial and i could not have more confidence in any man in addition to his individual strength of character the french people as a whole showed vitality and energy which were both impressive and gratifying their recovery from the postwar period is dramatic their productivity is increasing and they are steadily building their stature in both europe and africa and thus i left paris for vienna with increased confidence in western unity and strength the people of vienna know what it is to live under occupation and they know what it is to live in freedom their welcome to me as president of this country should be heartwarming to us all i went to vienna to meet the leader of the soviet union mr khrushchev for 2 days we met in sober intensive conversation and i believe it is my obligation to the people to the congress and to our allies to report on those conversations candidly and publicly mr khrushchev and i had a very full and frank exchange of views on the major issues that now divide our two countries i will tell you now that it was a very sober 2 days there was no discourtesy no loss of tempers no threats or ultimatums by either side no advantage or concession was either gained or given no major decision was either planned or taken no spectacular progress was either achieved or pretended this kind of informal exchange may not be as exciting as a full fledged summit meeting with a fixed agenda and a large corps of advisers where negotiations are attempted and new agreements sought but this was not intended to be and was not such a meeting nor did we plan any future summit meetings at vienna but i found this meeting with chairman khrushchev as somber as it was to be immensely useful i had read his speeches and of his policies i had been advised on his views i had been told by other leaders of the west general de gaulle chancellor adenauer prime minister macmillan what manner of man he was but i bear the responsibility of the presidency of the united states and it is my duty to make decisions that no adviser and no ally can make for me it is my obligation and responsibility to see that these decisions are as informed as possible that they are based on as much direct firsthand knowledge as possible i therefore thought it was of immense importance that i know mr khrushchev that i gain as much insight and understanding as i could on his present and future policies at the same time i wanted to make certain mr khrushchev knew this country and its policies that he understood our strength and our determination and that he knew that we desired peace with all nations of every kind i wanted to present our views to him directly precisely realistically and with an opportunity for discussion and clarification this was done no new aims were stated in private that have not been stated in public on either side the gap between us was not in such a short period materially reduced but at least the channels of communications were opened more fully at least the chances of a dangerous misjudgment on either side should now be less and at least the men on whose decisions the peace in part depends have agreed to remain in contact this is important for neither of us tried to merely please the other to agree merely to be agreeable to say what the other wanted to hear and just as our judicial system relies on witnesses appearing in court and on cross examination instead of hearsay testimony or affidavits on paper so too was this direct give and take of immeasurable value in making clear and precise what we considered to be vital for the facts of the matter are that the soviets and ourselves give wholly different meanings to the same words war peace democracy and popular will we have wholly different views of right and wrong of what is an internal affair and what is aggression and above all we have wholly different concepts of where the world is and where it is going only by such a discussion was it possible for me to be sure that mr khrushchev knew how differently we view the present and the future our views contrasted sharply but at least we knew better at the end where we both stood neither of us was there to dictate a settlement or to convert the other to a cause or to concede our basic interests but both of us were there i think because we realized that each nation has the power to inflict enormous damage upon the other that such a war could and should be avoided if at all possible since it would settle no dispute and prove no doctrine and that care should thus be taken to prevent our conflicting interests from so directly confronting each other that war necessarily ensued we believe in a system of national freedom and independence he believes in an expanding and dynamic concept of world communism and the question was whether these two systems can ever hope to live in peace without permitting any loss of security or any denial of the freedom of our friends however difficult it may seem to answer this question in the affirmative as we approach so many harsh tests i think we owe it to all mankind to make every possible effort that is why i considered the vienna talks to be useful the somber mood that they conveyed was not cause for elation or relaxation nor was it cause for undue pessimism or fear it simply demonstrated how much work we in the free world have to do and how long and hard a struggle must be our fate as americans in this generation as the chief defenders of the cause of liberty the one area which afforded some immediate prospect of accord was laos both sides recognized the need to reduce the dangers in that situation both sides endorsed the concept of a neutral and independent laos much in the manner of burma or cambodia of critical importance to the current conference on laos in geneva both sides recognized the importance of an effective cease fire it is urgent that this be translated into new attitudes at geneva enabling the international control commission to do its duty to make certain that a cease fire is enforced and maintained i am hopeful that progress can be made on this matter in the coming days at geneva for that would greatly improve international atmosphere no such hope emerged however with respect to the other deadlocked geneva conference seeking a treaty to ban nuclear tests mr khrushchev made it clear that there could not be a neutral administrator in his opinion because no one was truly neutral that a soviet veto would have to apply to acts of enforcement that inspection was only a subterfuge for espionage in the absence of total disarmament and that the present test ban negotiations appeared futile in short our hopes for an end to nuclear tests for an end to the spread of nuclear weapons and for some slowing down of the arms race have been struck a serious blow nevertheless the stakes are too important for us to abandon the draft treaty we have offered at geneva but our most somber talks were on the subject of germany and berlin i made it clear to mr khrushchev that the security of western europe and therefore our own security are deeply involved in our presence and our access rights to west berlin that those rights are based on law and not on sufferance and that we are determined to maintain those rights at any risk and thus meet our obligation to the people of west berlin and their right to choose their own future mr khrushchev in turn presented his views in detail and his presentation will be the subject of further communications but we are not seeking to change the present situation a binding german peace treaty is a matter for all who were at war with germany and we and our allies cannot abandon our obligations to the people of west berlin generally mr khrushchev did not talk in terms of war he believes the world will move his way without resort to force he spoke of his nation s achievements in space he stressed his intention to outdo us in industrial production to out trade us to prove to the world the superiority of his system over ours most of all he predicted the triumph of communism in the new and less developed countries he was certain that the tide there was moving his way that the revolution of rising peoples would eventually be a communist revolution and that the so called wars of liberation supported by the kremlin would replace the old methods of direct aggression and invasion in the 1940 s and early fifties the great danger was from communist armies marching across free borders which we saw in korea our nuclear monopoly helped to prevent this in other areas now we face a new and different threat we no longer have a nuclear monopoly their missiles they believe will hold off our missiles and their troops can match our troops should we intervene in these so called wars of liberation thus the local conflict they support can turn in their favor through guerrillas or insurgents or subversion a small group of disciplined communists could exploit discontent and misery in a country where the average income may be 60 or 70 a year and seize control therefore of an entire country without communist troops ever crossing any international frontier this is the communist theory but i believe just as strongly that time will prove it wrong that liberty and independence and self determination not communism is the future of man and that free men have the will and the resources to win the struggle for freedom but it is clear that this struggle in this area of the new and poorer nations will be a continuing crisis of this decade mr khrushchev made one point which i wish to pass on he said there are many disorders throughout the world and he should not be blamed for them all he is quite right it is easy to dismiss as communist inspired every anti government or anti american riot every overthrow of a corrupt regime or every mass protest against misery and despair these are not all communist inspired the communists move in to exploit them to infiltrate their leadership to ride their crest to victory but the communists did not create the conditions which caused them in short the hopes for freedom in these areas which see so much poverty and illiteracy so many children who are sick so many children who die in the first year so many families without homes so many families without hope the future for freedom in these areas rests with the local peoples and their governments if they have the will to determine their own future if their governments have the support of their own people if their honest and progressive measures helping their people have inspired confidence and zeal then no guerrilla or insurgent action can succeed but where those conditions do not exist a military guarantee against external attack from across a border offers little protection against internal decay yet all this does not mean that our nation and the west and the free world can only sit by on the contrary we have an historic opportunity to help these countries build their societies until they are so strong and broadly based that only an outside invasion could topple them and that threat we know can be stopped we can train and equip their forces to resist communist supplied insurrections we can help develop the industrial and agricultural base on which new living standards can be built we can encourage better administration and better education and better tax and land distribution and a better life for the people all this and more we can do because we have the talent and the resources to do it if we will only use and share them i know that there is a great deal of feeling in the united states that we have carried the burden of economic assistance long enough but these countries that we are now supporting stretching all the way along from the top of europe through the middle east down through saigon are now subject to great efforts internally in many of them to seize control if we re not prepared to assist them in making a better life for their people then i believe that the prospects for freedom in those areas are uncertain we must i believe assist them if we are determined to meet with commitments of assistance our words against the communist advance the burden is heavy we have carried it for many years but i believe that this fight is not over this battle goes on and we have to play our part in it and therefore i hope again that we will assist these people so that they can remain free it was fitting that congress opened its hearings on our new foreign military and economic aid programs in washington at the very time that mr khrushchev s words in vienna were demonstrating as nothing else could the need for that very program it should be well run effectively administered but i believe we must do it and i hope that you the american people will support it again because i think it s vitally important to the security of these areas there is no use talking against the communist advance unless we re willing to meet our responsibilities however burdensome they may be i do not justify this aid merely on the grounds of anti communism it is a recognition of our opportunity and obligation to help these people be free and we are not alone i found that the people of france for example were doing far more in africa in the way of aiding independent nations than our own country was but i know that foreign aid is a burden that is keenly felt and i can only say that we have no more crucial obligation now my stay in england was short but the visit gave me a chance to confer privately again with prime minister macmillan just as others of our party in vienna were conferring yesterday with general de gaulle and chancellor adenauer we all agreed that there is work to be done in the west and from our conversations have come agreed steps to get on with that work our day in london capped by a meeting with queen elizabeth and prince philip was a strong reminder at the end of a long journey that the west remains united in its determination to hold to its standards may i conclude by saying simply that i am glad to be home we have on this trip admired splendid places and seen stirring sights but we are glad to be home no demonstration of support abroad could mean so much as the support which you the american people have so generously given to our country with that support i am not fearful of the future we must be patient we must be determined we must be courageous we must accept both risks and burdens but with the will and the work freedom will prevail good night and thank you very much good evening my fellow

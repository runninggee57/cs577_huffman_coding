to brother handsome lake i have received the message in writing which you sent me through captain irvine our confidential agent placed near you for the purpose of communicating and transacting between us whatever may be useful for both nations i am happy to learn you have been so far favored by the divine spirit as to be made sensible of those things which are for your good and that of your people and of those which are hurtful to you and particularly that you and they see the ruinous effects which the abuse of spirituous liquors have produced upon them it has weakened their bodies enervated their minds exposed them to hunger cold nakedness and poverty kept them in perpetual broils and reduced their population i do not wonder then brother at your censures not only on your own people who have voluntarily gone into these fatal habits but on all the nations of white people who have supplied their calls for this article but these nations have done to you only what they do among themselves they have sold what individuals wish to buy leaving to every one to be the guardian of his own health and happiness spirituous liquors are not in themselves bad they are often found to be an excellent medicine for the sick it is the improper and intemperate use of them by those in health which makes them injurious but as you find that your people cannot refrain from an ill use of them i greatly applaud your resolution not to use them at all we have too affectionate a concern for your happiness to place the paltry gain on the sale of these articles in competition with the injury they do you and as it is the desire of your nation that no spirits should be sent among them i am authorized by the great council of the united states to prohibit them i will sincerely cooperate with your wise men in any proper measures for this purpose which shall be agreeable to them you remind me brother of what i said to you when you visited me the last winter that the lands you then held would remain yours and shall never go from you but when you should be disposed to sell this i now repeat and will ever abide by we indeed are always ready to buy land but we will never ask but when you wish to sell and our laws in order to protect you against imposition have forbidden individuals to purchase lands from you and have rendered it necessary when you desire to sell even to a state that an agent from the united states should attend the sale see that your consent is freely given a satisfactory price paid and report to us what has been done for our approbation this was done in the late case of which you complain the deputies of your nation came forward in all the forms which we have been used to consider as evidence of the will of your nation they proposed to sell to the state of new york certain parcels of land of small extent and detached from the body of your other lands the state of new york was desirous to buy i sent an agent in whom we could trust to see that your consent was free and the sale fair all was reported to be free and fair the lands were your property the right to sell is one of the rights of property to forbid you the exercise of that right would be a wrong to your nation nor do i think brother that the sale of lands is under all circumstances injurious to your people while they depended on hunting the more extensive the forest around them the more game they would yield but going into a state of agriculture it may be as advantageous to a society as it is to an individual who has more land than he can improve to sell a part and lay out the money in stocks and implements of agriculture for the better improvement of the residue a little land well stocked and improved will yield more than a great deal without stock or improvement i hope therefore that on further reflection you will see this transaction in a more favorable light both as it concerns the interest of your nation and the exercise of that superintending care which i am sincerely anxious to employ for their subsistence and happiness go on then brother in the great reformation you have undertaken persuade our red brethren then to be sober and to cultivate their lands and their women to spin and weave for their families you will soon see your women and children well fed and clothed your men living happily in peace and plenty and your numbers increasing from year to year it will be a great glory to you to have been the instrument of so happy a change and your children s children from generation to generation will repeat your name with love and gratitude forever in all your enterprises for the good of your people you may count with confidence on the aid and protection of the united states and on the sincerity and zeal with which i am myself animated in the furthering of this humane work you are our brethren of the same land we wish your prosperity as brethren should do farewell

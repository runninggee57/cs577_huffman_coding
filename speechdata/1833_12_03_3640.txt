fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives on your assembling to perform the high trusts which the people of the united states have confided to you of legislating for their common welfare it gives me pleasure to congratulate you upon the happy condition of our beloved country by the favor of divine providence health is again restored to us peace reigns within our borders abundance crowns the labors of our fields commerce and domestic industry flourish and increase and individual happiness rewards the private virtue and enterprise of our citizens our condition abroad is no less honorable than it is prosperous at home seeking nothing that is not right and determined to submit to nothing that is wrong but desiring honest friendships and liberal intercourse with all nations the united states have gained throughout the world the confidence and respect which are due to a policy so just and so congenial to the character of the american people and to the spirit of their institutions in bringing to your notice the particular state of our foreign affairs it affords me high gratification to inform you that they are in a condition which promises the continuance of friendship with all nations with great britain the interesting question of our north east boundary remains still undecided a negotiation however upon that subject has been renewed since the close of the last congress and a proposition has been submitted to the british government with the view of establishing in conformity with the resolution of the senate the line designated by the treaty of 1783 though no definitive answer has been received it may be daily looked for and i entertain a hope that the overture may ultimately lead to a satisfactory adjustment of this important matter i have the satisfaction to inform you that a negotiation which by desire of the house of representatives was opened some years ago with the british government for the erection of light houses on the bahamas has been successful those works when completed together with those which the united states have constructed on the western side of the gulf of florida will contribute essentially to the safety of navigation in that sea this joint participation in establishments interesting to humanity and beneficial to commerce is worthy of two enlightened nations and indicates feelings which can not fail to have a happy influence upon their political relations it is gratifying to the friends of both to perceive that the intercourse between the two people is becoming daily more extensive and that sentiments of mutual good will have grown up befitting their common origin and justifying the hope that by wise counsels on each side not only unsettled questions may be satisfactorily terminated but new causes of misunderstanding prevented not withstanding that i continue to receive the most amicable assurances from the government of france and that in all other respects the most friendly relations exist between the united states and that government it is to be regretted that the stipulations of the convention concluded on 1831 07 04 remain in some important parts unfulfilled by the second article of that convention it was stipulated that the sum payable to the united states should be paid at paris in 6 annual installments into the hands of such person or persons as should be authorized by the government of the united states to receive it and by the same article the first installment was payable on 1833 02 02 by the act of congress of 1832 07 13 it was made the duty of the secretary of the treasury to cause the several installments with the interest thereon to be received from the french government and transferred to the united states in such manner as he may deem best and by the same act of congress the stipulations on the part of the united states in the convention were in all respects fulfilled not doubting that a treaty thus made and ratified by the two governments and faithfully executed by the united states would be promptly complied with by the other party and desiring to avoid the risk and expense of intermediate agencies the secretary of the treasury deemed it advisable to receive and transfer the first installment by means of a draft upon the french minister of finance a draft for this purpose was accordingly drawn in favor of the cashier of the bank of the united states for the amount accruing to the united states out of the first installment and the interest payable with it this bill was not drawn at washington until 5 days after the installment was payable at paris and was accompanied by a special authority from the president authorizing the cashier or his assigns to receive the amount the mode thus adopted of receiving the installment was officially made known to the french government by the american charg d affaires at paris pursuant to instructions from the department of state the bill however though not presented for payment until 1833 03 23 was not paid and for the reason assigned by the french minister of finance that no appropriation had been made by the french chambers it is not known to me that up to that period any appropriation had been required of the chambers and although a communication was subsequently made to the chambers by direction of the king recommending that the necessary provision should be made for carrying the convention into effect it was at an advanced period of the session and the subject was finally postponed until the next meeting of the chambers not withstanding it has been supposed by the french ministry that the financial stipulations of the treaty can not be carried into effect without an appropriation by the chambers it appears to me to be not only consistent with the character of france but due to the character of both governments as well as to the rights of our citizens to treat the convention made and ratified in proper form as pledging the good faith of the french government for its execution and as imposing upon each department an obligation to fulfill it and i have received assurances through our charg d affaires at paris and the french minister plenipotentiary at washington and more recently through the minister of the united states at paris that the delay has not proceeded from any indisposition on the part of the king and his ministers to fulfill their treaty and that measures will be presented at the next meeting of the chambers and with a reasonable hope of success to obtain the necessary appropriation it is necessary to state however that the documents except certain lists of vessels captured condemned or burnt at sea proper to facilitate the examination and liquidation of the reclamations comprised in the stipulations of the convention and which by the 6th article france engaged to communicate to the united states by the intermediary of the legation though repeatedly applied for by the american charg d affaires under instructions from this government have not yet been communicated and this delay it is apprehended will necessarily prevent the completion of the duties assigned to the commissioners within the time at present prescribed by law the reasons for delaying to communicate these documents have not been explicitly stated and this is the more to be regretted as it is not understood that the interposition of the chambers is in any manner required for the delivery of those papers under these circumstances in a case so important to the interests of our citizens and to the character of our country and under disappointments so unexpected i deemed it my duty however i might respect the general assurances to which i have adverted no longer to delay the appointment of a minister plenipotentiary to paris but to dispatch him in season to communicate the result of his application to the french government at an early period of your session i accordingly appointed a distinguished citizen for this purpose who proceeded on his mission in august last and was presented to the king early in the month of october he is particularly instructed as to all matters connected with the present posture of affairs and i indulge the hope that with the representations he is instructed to make and from the disposition manifested by the king and his ministers in their recent assurances to our minister at paris the subject will be early considered and satisfactorily disposed of at the next meeting of the chambers as this subject involves important interests and has attracted a considerable share of the public attention i have deemed it proper to make this explicit statement of its actual condition and should i be disappointed in the hope now entertained the subject will be again brought to the notice of congress in such manner as the occasion may require the friendly relations which have always been maintained between the united states and russia have been further extended and strengthened by the treaty of navigation and commerce concluded on 1832 12 06 and sanctioned by the senate before the close of its last session the ratifications having been since exchanged the liberal provisions of the treaty are now in full force and under the encouragement which they have secured a flourishing and increasing commerce yielding its benefits to the enterprise of both nations affords to each the just recompense of wise measures and adds new motives for that mutual friendship which the two countries have hitherto cherished toward each other it affords me peculiar satisfaction to state that the government of spain has at length yielded to the justice of the claims which have been so long urged in behalf of our citizens and has expressed a willingness to provide an indemnification as soon as the proper amount can be agreed upon upon this latter point it is probable an understanding had taken place between the minister of the united states and the spanish government before the decease of the late king of spain and unless that event may have delayed its completion there is reason to hope that it may be in my power to announce to you early in your present session the conclusion of a convention upon terms not less favorable than those entered into for similar objects with other nations that act of justice would well accord with the character of spain and is due to the united states from their ancient friend it could not fail to strengthen the sentiments of amity and good will between the two nations which it is so much the wish of the united states to cherish and so truly the interest of both to maintain by the first section of an act of congress passed on 1832 07 13 the tonnage duty on spanish ships arriving from the ports of spain previous to 1817 10 20 being 5 cents per ton that act was intended to give effect on our side to an arrangement made with the spanish government by which discriminating duties of tonnage were to be abolished in the ports of the united states and spain on he vessels of the two nations pursuant to that arrangement which was carried into effect on the part of spain on 1832 05 20 by a royal order dated 1832 04 29 american vessels in the ports of spain have paid 5 cents per ton which rate of duty is also paid in those ports by spanish ships but as american vessels pay no tonnage duty in the ports of the united states the duty of 5 cents payable in our ports by spanish vessels under the act above mentioned is really a discriminating duty operating to the disadvantage of spain though no complaint has yet been made on the part of spain we are not the less bound by the obligations of good faith to remove the discrimination and i recommend that the act be amended accordingly as the royal order above alluded to includes the ports of the balearic and canary islands as well as those of spain it would seem that the provisions of the act of congress should be equally extensive and that for the repayments of such duties as may have been improperly received an addition should be made to the sum appropriated at the last session of congress for refunding discriminating duties as the arrangement referred to however did not embrace the islands of cuba and puerto rico discriminating duties to the prejudice of american shipping continue to be levied there from the extent of the commerce carried on between the united states and those islands particularly the former this discrimination causes serious injury to one of those great national interests which it has been considered an essential part of our policy to cherish and has given rise to complaints on the part of our merchants under instructions given to our minister at madrid earnest representations have been made by him to the spanish government upon this subject and there is reason to expect from the friendly disposition which is entertained toward this country that a beneficial change will be produced the disadvantage however to which our shipping is subjected by the operation of these discriminating duties requires that they be met by suitable countervailing duties during your present session power being at the same time vested in the president to modify or discontinue them as the discriminating duties on american vessels or their cargoes may be modified or discontinued at those islands intimations have been given to the spanish government that the united states may be obliged to resort to such measures as are of necessary self defense and there is no reason to apprehend that it would be unfavorably received the proposed proceeding if adopted would not be permitted however in any degree to induce a relaxation in the efforts of our minister to effect a repeal of this irregularity by friendly negotiation and it might serve to give force to his representations by showing the dangers to which that valuable trade is exposed by the obstructions and burdens which a system of discriminating and countervailing duties necessarily produces the selection and preparation of the florida archives for the purpose of being delivered over to the united states in conformity with the royal order as mentioned in my last annual message though in progress has not yet been completed this delay has been produced partly by causes which were unavoidable particularly the prevalence of the cholera at havana but measures have been taken which it is believed will expedite the delivery of those important records congress were informed at the opening of the last session that owing as was alleged to embarrassments in the finances of portugal consequent upon the civil war in which that nation was engaged payment had been made of only one installment of the amount which the portuguese government had stipulated to pay for indemnifying our citizens for property illegally captured in the blockade of terceira since that time a postponement for two years with interest of the 2 remaining installments was requested by the portuguese government and as a consideration it offered to stipulate that rice of the united states should be admitted into portugal at the same duties as brazilian rice being satisfied that no better arrangement could be made my consent was given and a royal order of the king of portugal was accordingly issued on 1833 02 04 for the reduction of the duty on rice of the united states it would give me great pleasure if in speaking of that country in whose prosperity the united states are so much interested and with whom a long subsisting extensive and mutually advantageous commercial intercourse has strengthened the relation of friendship i could announce to you the restoration of its internal tranquillity subsequently to the commencement of the last session of congress the final installment payable by denmark under the convention of 1830 03 28 was received the commissioners for examining the claims have since terminated their labors and their awards have been paid at the treasury as they have been called for the justice rendered to our citizens by that government is thus completed and a pledge is thereby afforded for the maintenance of that friendly intercourse becoming the relations that the two nations mutually bear to each other it is satisfactory to inform you that the danish government have recently issued an ordinance by which the commerce with the island of st croix is placed on a more liberal footing than heretofore this change can not fail to prove beneficial to the trade between the united states and that colony and the advantages likely to flow from it may lead to greater relaxations in the colonial systems of other nations the ratifications of the convention with the king of the two sicilies have been duly exchanged and the commissioners appointed for examining the claims under it have entered upon the duties assigned to them by law the friendship that the interests of the two nations require of them being now established it may be hoped that each will enjoy the benefits which a liberal commerce should yield to both a treaty of amity and commerce between the united states and belgium was concluded during the last winter and received the sanction of the senate but the exchange of the ratifications has been hitherto delayed in consequence in the first instance of some delay in the reception of the treaty at brussels and subsequently of the absence of the belgian minister of foreign affairs at the important conferences in which his government is engaged at london that treaty does but embody those enlarged principles of friendly policy which it is sincerely hoped will always regulate the conduct of the two nations having such strong motives to maintain amicable relations toward each other and so sincerely desirous to cherish them with all the other european powers with whom the united states have formed diplomatic relations and with the sublime porte the best understanding prevails from all i continue to receive assurances of good will toward the united states assurances which it gives me no less pleasure to reciprocate than to receive with all the engagements which have been entered into are fulfilled with good faith on both sides measures have also been taken to enlarge our friendly relations and extend our commercial intercourse with other states the system we have pursued of aiming at no exclusive advantages of dealing with all on terms of fair and equal reciprocity and of adhering scrupulously to all our engagements is well calculated to give success to efforts intended to be mutually beneficial the wars of which the southern part of this continent was so long the theater and which were carried on either by the mother country against the states which had formerly been her colonies or by the states against each other having terminated and their civil dissensions having so far subsided as with few exceptions no longer to disturb the public tranquillity it is earnestly hoped those states will be able to employ themselves without interruption in perfecting their institutions cultivating the arts of peace and promoting by wise councils and able exertions the public and private prosperity which their patriotic struggles so well entitle them to enjoy with those states our relations have under gone but little change during the present year no reunion having yet taken place between the states which composed the republic of colombia our charg d affaires at bogota has been accredited to the government of new grenada and we have therefore no diplomatic relations with venezuela and equator except as they may be included in those heretofore formed with the colombian republic it is understood that representatives from the three stattes were about to assemble at bogota to confer on the subject of their mutual interests particularly that of their union and if the result should render it necessary measures will be taken on our part to preserve with each that friendship and those liberal commercial connections which it has been the constant desire of the united states to cultivate with their sister republics of this hemisphere until the important question of reunion shall be settled however the different matters which have been under discussion between the united states and the republic of colombia or either of the states which composed it are not likely to be brought to a satisfactory issue in consequence of the illness of the charg d affaires appointed to central america at the last session of congress he was prevented from proceeding on his mission until the month of october it is hoped however that he is by this time at his post and that the official intercourse unfortunately so long interrupted has been thus renewed on the part of the two nations so amicably and advantageously connected by engagements founded on the most enlarged principles of commercial reciprocity it is gratifying to state that since my last annual message some of the most important claims of our fellow citizens upon the government of brazil have been satisfactorily adjusted and a reliance is placed on the friendly dispositions manifested by it that justice will also be done in others no new causes of complaint have arisen and the trade between the two countries flourishes under the encouragement secured to it by the liberal provisions of the treaty it is cause of regret that owing probably to the civil dissensions which have occupied the attention of the mexican government the time fixed by the treaty of limits with the united states for the meeting of the commissioners to define the boundaries between the two nations has been suffered to expire without the appointment of any commissioners on the part of that government while the true boundary remains in doubt by either party it is difficult to give effect to those measures which are necessary to the protection and quiet of our numerous citizens residing near that frontier the subject is one of great solicitude to the united states and will not fail to receive my earnest attention the treaty concluded with chili and approved by the senate at its last session was also ratified by the chilian government but with certain additional and explanatory articles of a nature to have required it to be again submitted to the senate the time limited for the exchange of the ratification however having since expired the action of both governments on the treaty will again become necessary the negotiations commenced with the argentine republic relative to the outrages committed on our vessels engaged in the fisheries at the falkland islands by persons acting under the color of its authority as well as the other matters in controversy between the two governments have been suspended by the departure of the charg d affaires of the united states from buenos ayres it is understood however that a minister was subsequently appointed by that government to renew the negotiation in the united states but though daily expected he has not yet arrived in this country with peru no treaty has yet been formed and with bolivia no diplomatic intercourse has yet been established it will be my endeavor to encourage those sentiments of amity and that liberal commerce which belong to the relations in which all the independent states of this continent stand toward each other i deem it proper to recommend to your notice the revision of our consular system this has become an important branch of the public service in as much as it is intimately connected with the preservation of our national character abroad with the interest of our citizens in foreign countries with the regulation and care of our commerce and with the protection of our sea men at the close of the last session of congress i communicated a report from the secretary of state upon the subject to which i now refer as containing information which may be useful in any inquiries that congress may see fit to institute with a view to a salutary reform of the system it gives me great pleasure to congratulate you upon the prosperous condition of the finances of the country as will appear from the report which the secretary of the treasury will in due time lay before you the receipts into the treasury during the present year will amount to more than 32 000 000 the revenue derived from customs will it is believed be more than 28 000 000 and the public lands will yield about 3 0900 000 the expenditures within the year for all objects including 2 572 240 99 on account of the public debt will not amount to 25 000 000 and a large balance will remain in the treasury after satisfying all the appropriations chargeable on the revenue for the present year the measures taken by the secretary of the treasury will probably enable to pay off in the course of the present year the residue of the exchanged 4 5 stock redeemable on 1834 01 01 it has therefore been included in the estimated expenditures of this year and forms a part of the sum above stated to have been paid on account of the public debt the payment of this stock will reduce the whole debt of the united states funded and unfunded to the sum of 4 760 082 08 and as provision has already been made for the 4 5 stocks above mentioned and charged in the expenses of the present year the sum last stated is all that now remains of the national debt and the revenue of the coming year together with the balance now in the treasury will be sufficient to discharge it after meeting the current expenses of the government under the power given to the commissioners of the sinking fund it will i have no doubt be purchased on favorable terms within the year from this view of the state of the finances and the public engagements yet to be fulfilled you will perceive that if providence permits me to meet you at another session i shall have the high gratification of announcing to you that the national debt is extinguished i can not refrain from expressing the pleasure i feel at the near approach of that desirable event the short period of time within which the public debt will have been discharged is strong evidence of the abundant resources of the country and of the prudence and economy with which the government has heretofore been administered we have waged two wars since we became a nation with one of the most powerful kingdoms in the world both of them undertaken in defense of our dearest rights been successfully prosecuted and honorably terminated and many of those who partook in the first struggle as well as in the second will have lived to see the last item of the debt incurred in these necessary but expensive conflicts faithfully and honestly discharged and we shall have the proud satisfaction of bequeathing to the public servants who follow us in the administration of the government the rare blessing of a revenue sufficiently abundant raised without injustice or oppression to our citizens and unencumbered with any burdens but what they themselves shall think proper to impose upon it the flourishing state of the finances ought not however to encourage us to indulge in a lavish expenditure of the public treasure the receipts of the present year do not furnish the test by which we are to estimate the income of the next the changes made in our revenue system by the acts of congress of 1832 and 1833 and more especially by the former have swelled the receipts of the present year far beyond the amount to be expected in future years upon the reduced tariff of duties the shortened credits on revenue bonds and the cash duties on woolens which were introduced by the act of 1832 and took effect on 1832 03 04 have brought large sums into the treasury in 1833 which according to the credits formerly given would not have been payable until 1834 and would have formed a part of the income of that year these causes would of themselves produce a great diminution of the receipts in the year 1834 as compared with the present one and they will be still more diminished by the reduced rates of duties which take place on 1834 01 01 on some of the most important and productive articles upon the best estimates that can be made the receipts of the next year with the aid of the unappropriated amount now in the treasury will not be much more than sufficient to meet the expenses of the year and pay the small remnant of the national debt which yet remains unsatisfied i can not therefore recommend to you any alteration in the present tariff of duties the rate as now fixed by law on the various articles was adopted at the last session of congress as a matter of compromise with unusual unanimity and unless it is found to produce more than the necessities of the government call for there would seem to be no reason at this time to justify a change but while i forbear to recommend any further reduction of the duties beyond that already provided for by the existing laws i must earnestly and respectfully press upon congress the importance of abstaining from all appropriations which are not absolutely required for the public interest and authorized by the powers clearly delegated to the united states we are beginning a new era in our government the national debt which has so long been a burden on the treasury will be finally discharged in the course of the ensuing year no more memory will afterwards be needed than what may be necessary to meet the ordinary expenses of the government now then is the proper moment to fix our system of expenditure on firm and durable principles and i can not too strongly urge the necessity of a rigid economy and an inflexible determination not to enlarge the income beyond the real necessities of the government and not to increase the wants of the government by unnecessary and profuse expenditures if a contrary course should be pursued it may happen that the revenue of 1834 will fall short of the demands upon it and after reducing the tariff in order to lighten the burdens of the people and providing for a still further reduction to take effect hereafter it would be much to be deplored if at the end of another year we should find ourselves obliged to retrace our steps and impose additional taxes to meet unnecessary expenditures it is my duty on this occasion to call your attention to the destruction of the public building occupied by the treasury department which happened since the last adjournment of congress a thorough inquiry into the causes of this loss was directed and made at the time the result of which will be duly communicated to you i take pleasure however in stating here that by the laudable exertions of the officers of the department and many of the citizens of the district but few papers were lost and none that will materially affect the public interest the public convenience requires that another building should be erected as soon as practicable and in providing for it it will be advisable to enlarge in some manner the accommodations for the public officers of the several departments and to authorize the erection of suitable depositories for the safe keeping of the public documents and records since the last adjournment of congress the secretary of the treasury has directed the money of the united states to be deposited in certain state banks designated by him and he will immediately lay before you his reasons for this direction i concur with him entirely in the view he has taken on the subject and some months before the removal i urged upon the department the propriety of taking that step the near approach of the day on which the charger will expire as well as the conduct of the bank appeared to me to call for this measure upon the high considerations of public interest and public duty the extent of its misconduct however although known to be great was not at that time fully developed by proof it was not until late in the month of august that i received from the government directors an official report establishing beyond question that this great and powerful institution had been actively engaged in attempting to influence the elections of the public officers by means of its money and that in violation of the express provisions of its charter it had by a formal resolution placed its funds at the disposition of its president to be employed in sustaining the political power of the bank a copy of this resolution is contained in the report of the government directors before referred to and how ever the object may be disguised by cautious language no one can doubt that this money was in truth intended for electioneering purposes and the particular uses to which it was proved to have been applied abundantly show that it was so understood not only was the evidence complete as to the past application of the money and power of the bank to electioneering purposes but that the resolution of the board of directors authorized the same course to be pursued in future it being thus established by unquestionable proof that the bank of the united states was converted into a permanent electioneering engine it appeared to me that the path of duty which the executive department of the government ought to pursue was not doubtful as by the terms of the bank charter no officer but the secretary of the treasury could remove the deposits it seemed to me that this authority ought to be at once exerted to deprive that great corporation of the support and countenance of the government in such an use of its and such an exertion of its power in this point of the case the question is distinctly presented whether the people of the united states are to govern through representatives chosen by their unbiased suffrages or whether the money and power of a great corporation are to be secretly exerted to influence their judgment and control their decisions it must now be determined whether the bank is to have its candidates for all offices in the country from the highest to the lowest or whether candidates on both sides of political questions shall be brought forward as heretofore and supported by the usual means at this time the efforts of the bank to control public opinion through the distresses of some and the fears of others are equally apparent and if possible more objectionable by a curtailment of its accommodations more rapid than any emergency requires and even while it retains specie to an almost unprecedented amount in its vaults it is attempting to produce great embarrassment in one portion of the community while through presses known to have been sustained by its money it attempts by unfounded alarms to create a panic in all these are the means by which it seems to expect that it can force a restoration of the deposits and as a necessary consequence extort from congress a renewal of its charter i am happy to know that through the good sense of our people the effort to get up a panic has hitherto failed and that through the increased accommodations which the state banks have been enabled to afford no public distress has followed the exertions of the bank and it can not be doubted that the exercise of its power and the expenditure of its money as well as its efforts to spread groundless alarm will be met and rebuked as they deserve in my own sphere of duty i should feel myself called on by the facts disclosed to order a scire facias against the bank with a view to put an end to the chartered rights it has so palpably violated were it not that the charter itself will expire as soon as a decision would probably be obtained from the court of last resort i called the attention of congress to this subject in my last annual message and informed them that such measures as were within the reach of the secretary of the treasury had been taken to enable him to judge whether the public deposits in the bank of the united states were entirely safe but that as his single powers might be inadequate to the object i recommended the subject to congress as worthy of their serious investigation declaring it as my opinion that an inquiry into the transactions of that institution embracing the branches as well as the principal bank was called for by the credit which was given throughout the country to many serious charges impeaching their character and which if true might justly excite the apprehension that they were no longer a safe depository for the public money the extent to which the examination thus recommended was gone into is spread upon your journals and is too well known to require to be stated such as was made resulted in a report from a majority of the committee of ways and means touching certain specified points only concluding with a resolution that the government deposits might safely be continued in the bank of the united states this resolution was adopted at the close of the session by the vote of a majority of the house of representatives although i may not always be able to concur in the views of the public interest or the duties of its agents which may be taken by the other departments of the government or either of its branches i am not withstanding wholly incapable of receiving otherwise than with the most sincere respect all opinions or suggestions proceeding from such a source and in respect to none am i more inclined to do so than to the house of representatives but it will be seen from the brief views at this time taken of the subject by myself as well as the more ample ones presented by the secretary of the treasury that the change in the deposits which has been ordered has been deemed to be called for by considerations which are not affected by the proceedings referred to and which if correctly viewed by that department rendered its act a matter of imperious duty coming as you do for the most part immediately from the people and the states by election and possessing the fullest opportunity to know their sentiments the present congress will be sincerely solicitous to carry into full and fair effect the will of their constituents in regard to this institution it will be for those in whose behalf we all act to decide whether the executive department of the government in the steps which it has taken on this subject has been found in the line of its duty the accompanying report of the secretary of war with the documents annexed to it exhibits the operations of the war department for the past year and the condition of the various subjects intrusted to its administration it will be seen from them that the army maintains the character it has heretofore acquired for efficiency and military knowledge nothing has occurred since your last session to require its services beyond the ordinary routine duties which upon the sea board and the in land frontier devolve upon it in a time of peace the system so wisely adopted and so long pursued of constructing fortifications at exposed points and of preparing and collecting the supplies necessary for the military defense of the country and thus providently furnishing in peace the means of defense in war has been continued with the usual results i recommend to your consideration the various subjects suggested in the report of the secretary of war their adoption would promote the public service and meliorate the condition of the army our relations with the various indian tribes have been undisturbed since the termination of the difficulties growing out of the hostile aggressions of the sac and fox indians several treaties have been formed for the relinquishment of territory to the united states and for the migration of the occupants of the region assigned for their residence west of the mississippi should these treaties be ratified by the senate provision will have been made for the removal of almost all the tribes remaining e of that river and for the termination of many difficult and embarrassing questions arising out of their anomalous political condition it is to be hoped that those portions of two of the southern tribes which in that event will present the only remaining difficulties will realize the necessity of emigration and will speedily resort to it my original convictions upon this subject have been confirmed by the course of events for several years and experience is every day adding to their strength that those tribes can not exist surrounded by our settlements and in continual contact with our citizens is certain they have neither the intelligence the industry the moral habits nor the desire of improvement which are essential to any favorable change in their condition established in the midst of another and a superior race and without appreciating the causes of their inferiority or seeking to control them they must necessarily yield to the force of circumstances and ere long disappear such has been their fate heretofore and if it is to be averted and it is it can only be done by a general removal beyond our boundary and by the reorganization of their political system upon principles adapted to the new relations in which they will be placed the experiment which has been recently made has so far proved successful the emigrants generally are represented to be prosperous and contented the country suitable to their wants and habits and the essential articles of subsistence easily procured when the report of the commissioners now engaged in investigating the condition and prospects of these indians and in devising a plan for their intercourse and government is received i trust ample means of information will be in possession of the government for adjusting all the unsettled questions connected with this interesting subject the operations of the navy during the year and its present condition are fully exhibited in the annual report from the navy department suggestions are made by the secretary of various improvements which deserve careful consideration and most of which if adopted bid fair to promote the efficiency of this important branch of the public service among these are the new organization of the navy board the revision of the pay to officers and a change in the period of time or in the manner of making the annual appropriations to which i beg leave to call your particular attention the views which are presented on almost every portion of our naval concerns and especially on the amount of force and the number of officers and the general course of policy appropriate in the present state of our country for securing the great and useful purposes of naval protection in peace and due preparation for the contingencies of war meet with my entire approbation it will be perceived from the report referred to that the fiscal concerns of the establishment are in an excellent condition and it is hoped that congress may feel disposed to make promptly every suitable provision desired either for preserving or improving the system the general post office department has continued upon the strength of its own resources to facilitate the means of communication between the various portions of the union with increased activity the method however in which the accounts of the transportation of the mail have always been kept appears to have presented an imperfect view of its expenses it has recently been discovered that from the earliest records of the department the annual statements have been calculated to exhibit an amount considerably short of the actual expense incurred for that service these illusory statements together with the expense of carrying into effect the law of the last session of congress establishing new mail routes and a disposition on the part of the head of the department to gratify the wishes of the public in the extension of mail facilities have induced him to incur responsibilities for their improvement beyond what the current resources of the department would sustain as soon as he had discovered the imperfection of the method he caused an investigation to be made of its results and applied the proper remedy to correct the evil it became necessary for him to withdraw some of the improvements which he had made to bring the expenses of the department within its own resources these expenses were incurred for the public good and the public have enjoyed their benefit they are now but partially suspended and that where they may be discontinued with the least inconvenience to the country the progressive increase in the income from postages has equaled the highest expectations and it affords demonstrative evidence of the growing importance and great utility of this department the details are exhibited in the accompanying report of the postmaster general the many distressing accidents which have of late occurred in that portion of our navigation carried on by the use of steam power deserve the immediate and unremitting attention of the constituted authorities of the country the fact that the number of those fatal disasters is constantly increasing not withstanding the great improvements which are every where made in the machinery employed and in the rapid advances which have made in that branch of science shows very clearly that they are in a great degree the result of criminal negligence on the part of those by whom the vessels are navigated and to whose care and attention the lives and property of our citizens are so extensively intrusted that these evils may be greatly lessened if not substantially removed by means of precautionary and penal legislation seems to be highly probably so far therefore as the subject can be regarded as within the constitutional purview of congress i earnestly recommend it to your prompt and serious consideration i would also call your attention to the views i have heretofore expressed of the propriety of amending the constitution in relation to the mode of electing the president and the vice president of the united states regarding it as all important to the future quiet and harmony of the people that every intermediate agency in the election of these officers should be removed and that their eligibility should be limited to one term of either 4 or 6 years i can not too earnestly invite your consideration of the subject trusting that your deliberations on all the topics of general interest to which i have adverted and such others as your more extensive knowledge of the wants of our beloved country may suggest may be crowned with success i tender you in conclusion the cooperation which it may be in my power to afford them

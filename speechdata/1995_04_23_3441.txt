thank you very much governor keating and mrs keating reverend graham to the families of those who have been lost and wounded to the people of oklahoma city who have endured so much and the people of this wonderful state to all of you who are here as our fellow americans i am honored to be here today to represent the american people but i have to tell you that hillary and i also come as parents as husband and wife as people who were your neighbors for some of the best years of our lives today our nation joins with you in grief we mourn with you we share your hope against hope that some may still survive we thank all those who have worked so heroically to save lives and to solve this crime those here in oklahoma and those who are all across this great land and many who left their own lives to come here to work hand in hand with you we pledge to do all we can to help you heal the injured to rebuild this city and to bring to justice those who did this evil this terrible sin took the lives of our american family innocent children in that building only because their parents were trying to be good parents as well as good workers citizens in the building going about their daily business and many there who served the rest of us who worked to help the elderly and the disabled who worked to support our farmers and our veterans who worked to enforce our laws and to protect us let us say clearly they served us well and we are grateful but for so many of you they were also neighbors and friends you saw them at church or the pta meetings at the civic clubs at the ball park you know them in ways that all the rest of america could not and to all the members of the families here present who have suffered loss though we share your grief your pain is unimaginable and we know that we cannot undo it that is god s work our words seem small beside the loss you have endured but i found a few i wanted to share today i ve received a lot of letters in these last terrible days one stood out because it came from a young widow and a mother of three whose own husband was murdered with over 200 other americans when pan am 103 was shot down here is what that woman said i should say to you today the anger you feel is valid but you must not allow yourselves to be consumed by it the hurt you feel must not be allowed to turn into hate but instead into the search for justice the loss you feel must not paralyze your own lives instead you must try to pay tribute to your loved ones by continuing to do all the things they left undone thus ensuring they did not die in vain wise words from one who also knows you have lost too much but you have not lost everything and you have certainly not lost america for we will stand with you for as many tomorrows as it takes if ever we needed evidence of that i could only recall the words of governor and mrs keating if anybody thinks that americans are mostly mean and selfish they ought to come to oklahoma if anybody thinks americans have lost the capacity for love and caring and courage they ought to come to oklahoma to all my fellow americans beyond this hall i say one thing we owe those who have sacrificed is the duty to purge ourselves of the dark forces which gave rise to this evil they are forces that threaten our common peace our freedom our way of life let us teach our children that the god of comfort is also the god of righteousness those who trouble their own house will inherit the wind justice will prevail let us let our own children know that we will stand against the forces of fear when there is talk of hatred let us stand up and talk against it when there is talk of violence let us stand up and talk against it in the face of death let us honor life as st paul admonished us let us not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good yesterday hillary and i had the privilege of speaking with some children of other federal employees children like those who were lost here and one little girl said something we will never forget she said we should all plant a tree in memory of the children so this morning before we got on the plane to come here at the white house we planted that tree in honor of the children of oklahoma it was a dogwood with its wonderful spring flower and its deep enduring roots it embodies the lesson of the psalms that the life of a good person is like a tree whose leaf does not wither my fellow americans a tree takes a long time to grow and wounds take a long time to heal but we must begin those who are lost now belong to god some day we will be with them but until that happens their legacy must be our lives thank you all and god bless you

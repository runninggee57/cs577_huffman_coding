the president ladies and gentlemen i have come before you today for a regular scheduled televised notified well in advance press conference i did not drive myself over here but i did have to cancel an informal meeting with some tourists at the gate i am happy to see here today so many visiting members of the american society of newspaper editors so many of my old friends you are welcome to your city i have some information on the state of our national economy in the first quarter of 1964 our gross national product rose to a rate of 608 billion this is up 8 billion from the fourth quarter of 1963 the first quarter gross national product is nearly 37 billion above the year earlier figure it is the largest year to year gain i am told by the chairman of the economic council this afternoon in more than 2 years personal income in march ran at a rate of 480 billion an increase of 1 billion over february and 25 7 billion over the rate of march 1963 for the first time in 2 years we are making real progress in cutting down unemployment we had a net gain of 1 1 2 million jobs from a year ago the jobless rate dropped from 5 8 percent to 5 4 percent and some other facts i think are worthy of note labor has gained over 4 million jobs nonfarm jobs in a 3 year period and over 56 billion of added annual income business has gained a 50 percent advance in profits after taxes moreover these wage and profit gains have not been eaten away by inflation prices in the united states have been more stable than in any other industrial country in the world with strong markets with steady costs with lower taxes american business does not need higher price levels to assure continued growth and profits i look therefore to responsible business and to responsible labor to help us maintain our very fine record of cost and price stability and help us go all the way to full employment and a balanced budget and a strong enough competitive position to wipe out the balance of payments deficits i believe the accurate picture of what is happening in the railroad strike negotiations has been presented fully and completely but this may interest you i do want to stress my deep and earnest hope that these negotiations will strengthen the collective bargaining processes in our country to me it is vitally important that we preserve our free enterprise system free enterprise assumes a capacity of both labor and management to handle their own affairs and to settle differences by negotiations i do not think that we serve the cause of free enterprise by precipitating situations which could lead to a breakdown of this process the public interest must and will be served i think it is in the public interest to proceed by negotiation wherever possible intensive negotiation day and night negotiation is now going on assisted by the mediators who are experienced men that i have appointed and who have come here at great sacrifice it is a genuine collective bargaining in the true sense of the word and i have great faith in the capacity of true collective bargaining there have been fewer strikes since january 1961 than in any other 3 year period since the early thirties there have been fewer workers involved in strikes in the period since january 1961 than during any comparable 3 year period since the early thirties there have been fewer man days lost because of strikes since 1961 than in any comparable 3 year period since world war ii there were more strikes and more people involved in them during the world war ii period but they were settled as you know much more quickly which meant fewer man days were lost i am today establishing a program of presidential scholars the title will be given to outstanding scholars graduating from our secondary schools public and private throughout the nation these awards are to recognize the most precious resource of the united states the brain power of its young people to encourage the pursuit of intellectual attainments among all our youth it is my hope that in the future a similar system can be worked out to honor our most gifted young people in the creative arts two presidential scholars a boy and a girl will be named from each state two will be named from puerto rico two from the district of columbia two from the american territories and up to 15 at large the presidential scholars will be chosen by a commission on presidential scholars which consists of dr milton eisenhower president of johns hopkins university the chairman of the commission leonard bernstein katherine anne porter dr albert w dent president of dillard university of new orleans the reverend michael p walsh president of boston college dr william hagerty president of drexel institute of technology philadelphia and mr melvin w barnes the superintendent of schools of portland oreg the commission will operate with complete independence the presidential scholars will be named in may of this year the president will invite them to the white house as guests of this nation and present each with a medallion symbolizing the honor on march 30th the senate passed a bill which would authorize and investigate and study the possible construction of a sea level canal connecting the atlantic and pacific oceans this bill has been referred to the house committee on merchant marine and fisheries this administration supports this bill and hopes that the house committee will give early and favorable consideration to it there are several alternative routes for such a canal which will have to be studied carefully before a decision can be made as part of the necessary studies the united states and the government of colombia have already reached an agreement to conduct studies relative to a survey for a sea level canal we are just able to announce this agreement today we hope to make similar arrangements with other countries later i have instructed the secretary of defense to immediately dispatch a survey team to colombia to explore the possibility of constructing a sea level canal in that country the secretary of defense has informed me that a 10 man team will leave for colombia tomorrow morning to begin work immediately the united states team will work in close collaboration with the team of the colombian government i am very pleased to announce the appointment of mr roger stevens of new york as my assistant to advise me on the arts to assist mr stevens and to provide a forum for the representation of all the arts of the united states i shall shortly issue an executive order establishing a presidential board on the arts i have invited prime minister krag of denmark and mrs krag to visit washington on june 9th mrs johnson and i visited them last year the prime minister has accepted the invitation and he and mrs krag will be coming to washington following their participation in denmark day at the new york world s fair i am looking forward to seeing two of my old friends from germany this summer the governing mayor of berlin willy brandt will be here on may 18th the federal chancellor ludwig erhard who was here earlier in the year will come back on june 12th i will be glad to have any questions q mr president how do you feel about civil disobedience as a tactic in the civil rights struggle the president i think that we have a civil rights bill pending in the senate that has passed the house it is very important that bill be passed at the earliest possible date i think passage of that bill will be helpful in this general situation we do not of course condone violence or taking the law into your own hands or threatening the health or safety of our people you really do the civil rights cause no good when you go to this extent but we are hopeful that all americans understand that we are going to pass the civil rights bill because it is morally right and because we feel that these people have too long been denied their rights on the other hand we do not think the violation of one right or the denial of one right should permit the violation of another right q mr president there have been some conflicting high level statements over the last week about our strength militarily as compared with russia s particularly in the fields of missiles and air power would you give your own appraisal of that the president yes i am pleased with our strength i think we have made great gains during the last 3 years when you realize that each year during the last 3 years we have spent approximately 6 billion more on our military budget than was spent the last year of the eisenhower administration when you realize that we are spending 8 billion more this year than was spent the last year of the eisenhower administration on our military budget you realize that approximately 25 billion more has been spent than would have been spent if we had gone on at the rate of the last year of the republican administration for that expenditure of 25 billion we have achieved extra combat divisions extra nuclear warheads extra missile strength i am pleased with those accomplishments under the law the secretary of defense mr mcnamara is charged with the leadership and the direction of the defense department while he operates a tight budget i think he operates an adequate one i think his work has been constructive i have confidence in him the congress has confidence in him i believe the american people have confidence in him you can depend on what he tells you q mr president what do you see in the future and particularly in the near future in the field of soviet american trade and in particular do you see another major development in the wake of the wheat sale the president no i do not anticipate another major development at this time i am encouraged by the fact that there are approaches being made to purchase some things from our country and the foreign relations committee of the senate is now having hearings and giving study to the possibilities of increasing east west trade but so far as anticipating just the extent of that trade and in what lines it will be i am not able to say q mr president in connection with the railroad situation you have emphasized the value of free collective bargaining and at the same time you have in this case brought the very considerable weight of the presidency to bear in influencing the action by postponing a strike do you have some general guideline as to where the public interest in preventing strikes comes up against the public interest in the freedom to bargain the president i think that this is a matter that the mediators and the negotiators representing each side will attempt to evolve and find an agreeable ground and a common solution i am not an overly optimistic man but i do believe that under our collective bargaining system a result can be reached i hope and pray that it will be by the end of the week q mr president a group of newspaper editors many of whom are in this room now were polled as to your chances for winning in 1964 they all agreed that you would win it was a matter of how much you would win by would you care to comment on that sir the president no i hope that they feel in november as they do in april q mr president seven of the eight members of the seato military organization have taken a strong stand on support for south viet nam the eighth member france had reservations on this do you believe that this impairs the effectiveness of that organization or our policy in south viet nam the president of course we would have preferred the decision to be unanimous and we would have liked for our friend and ally france to have seen the situation as did the other seven members of seato we are very pleased however that seven of us saw things alike we have a definite policy in viet nam you know what that policy is we think it is the best policy that could be derived from the alternatives open to us and we are very pleased and happy that secretary rusk found that at least seven signatories of seato were willing to go along with us q mr president after nearly 5 months in office i wonder if you could assess for us whether you find the task more or less difficult than you had anticipated the president well i didn t do a great deal of anticipating prior to november on just how difficult the task would be but i enjoy it there is a lot of work connected with it nearly everyone is anxious to help you do that job most people are hoping and praying that you do a good job and a very few people i have called on that have not been willing to put their shoulder to the wheel and help me it is probably more difficult than i expected it would be but i am enjoying it and i am prepared to continue q mr president there has been considerable talk in the press and in congress relative to the lbj company ktbc owned by mrs johnson and relative to a secret option agreement the fcc has asked that that option agreement be made available i wonder what your view is on that if you feel it is proper that it not be disclosed i also would like to know how you feel about the general ethical question that has been raised relative to high governmental officials whether in the executive branch or the legislative who have interests in government regulated industries such as television the president well first i don t have any interest in government regulated industries of any kind and never have had i own no stocks i own a little ranch land something in excess of 2 000 acres the commission has made no request of me or of my family for anything we are perfectly willing to comply i am sure the trustees would be with any request that they did make there is not anything that we have to secrete in any manner shape or form mrs johnson inherited some property invested that property in the profession of her choice and worked at it with pleasure and satisfaction until i forced her to leave it when i assumed the presidency as you know and i want all to know all of that stock has been placed in trust as has been the practice with other presidents and although i own none of it mrs johnson has placed it in trust an irrevocable trust that can the property can be disposed of it can be leased it can be sold at any time any of those decisions would still require the action of the commission even if you tried to sell it you would have to have their approval but i see no conflict in any way she participates in no decisions the company makes it is entirely with the trustees in any event if she did participate the president wouldn t have anything to do with it q as you know we now have a record number of military and diplomatic dependents abroad well over seven hundred thousand in your concern for the american image and your admirable desire to improve the status of women don t you think it would be worth the expense to provide language courses for these wives before they go overseas the president i think it is always desirable for anyone to acquire as much knowledge of languages as possible i haven t given any study to the particular suggestion you make it seems to be a good one and i will have it explored q mr president in recent months the air force and certain members of congress have said that it is desirable for the united states to develop a new manned strategic bomber secretary of defense mcnamara maintains that it is not i wonder if you could give us your opinion sir the president at the moment i would not make a judgment because that decision will likely come to me in the near future when the joint chiefs of staff presented their military recommendations to me at the early part of the year they were together on all of the recommendations with the exception that general lemay asked for the privilege of taking funds already calculated in his budget and using them to study plans for a new bomber i told him i would give consideration to his proposal i understand that proposal has been formulated and is now going through channels and will shortly come to the president when it gets to me i will study it as best i can and make the decision that i think is in the national interest q mr president to go back to politics the late president kennedy in looking ahead to the 64 election used to say that he expected a hard close fight would you say sir how it looks to you this far ahead of the event the president i would think that is a very accurate appraisal of it and i would think it will be a hard fight a difficult one i would hope that it wouldn t be too close but it may be i don t think that you can ever tell this far in advance how people are going to decide the choice but i have no doubt but what it will be a hard and long fight q mr president there has been a new factor injected into the civil rights situation mr president there has been allusion here today to difficulty of extremist action on the part of civil rights leaders but there seems also to be a possibility of extreme action on the part of some white people who are mightily opposed both north and south not only to the bill but to further progress for negroes would you assess this new factor and do you have any counsel to the people on that end of the battle the president yes i would counsel moderation to all groups and understanding of their fellowman and trying to appreciate his position i think if people would put themselves in the other fellow s position they will all be a little more tolerant of the other man s viewpoint there are people who feel very strongly on both sides of this issue i found that in the 1957 bill i found it in the bill in 1960 it took us many days and nights to try to find an area of agreement that the members of congress and the president would accept i expect that there will be many days ahead when strong forces on both sides will be appealing to people to side with them i only hope that we recognize that it has been a hundred years since abraham lincoln freed the slaves of their chains but he has not freed all of the people of the bigotry that exists it has been a hundred years since president lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation but a great many people do not have equal rights as of now while emancipation may be a proclamation it is not a fact until education is blind to color until employment is unaware of race as long as those conditions exist in the country we are going to have protests and we are entitled to protest and petition under our constitutional rights i hope though that the congress will act promptly with reasonable dispatch to bring those protests and bring those petitions and bring these disturbances from the streets and the alleys into the courts where they belong in order to do that we need a good civil rights bill and the bill now pending in the senate is a good bill i hope it can be passed in a reasonable time q mr president could you list for us the pending legislative measures which you consider it essential that the congress enact before it adjourns finally this summer the president well that would take more time than i have but there are some that we are vitally interested in i have just named one the civil rights bill that is pending in the senate we had difficulty in the house judiciary committee it spent a long time there then the house rules committee we filed a petition and a good many members signed that to discharge the bill and finally the rules committee passed it it is now in the senate and it has been debated a good while there so that is a very important piece of legislation for the national welfare because we are going to have many problems even after it is passed adjusting to it we ought to get it passed as early as we can so that before school begins next year we will have this law on the books and we can move ahead i think it is as important that we pass the food stamp plan in the senate as the civil rights bill we passed it in the house by a good vote the other day it is very important not only to the consumers of this country but to the producers of this country and to the business people of this country it is a good piece of legislation it is soundly conceived i hope that we can get action in the agriculture committee of the senate in a short time perhaps as soon as the civil rights bill is out of the way we can pass the food stamp bill the pay bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation to continued good government in this country i have on my desk today a number of resignations from some of the very best men in government who tell me that they just cannot stay any longer they have been here 3 years and they cannot stay any longer at their present salaries one man said he had had to borrow 16 000 another one said he had had to borrow 19 000 another one 6 000 and they just did not feel they could go on doing that if the pay bill was not going to be passed i think that we are going to lose some of the best men in the government like sergeants that run the army some of the under secretaries and assistant secretaries and the men who do not get the notoriety but do the hard work from day to day are entitled to a raise i hope the congress will consider the bill in both committees although they have taken one vote on it in the house that they can make some adjustments to meet the objections of the members and pass the pay bill i think the medicare bill is an extremely important bill that will provide medical care for our old people aged people under social security i believe that we are close to having enough votes to report that bill from the committee if we can make adjustments and modifications to get that bill reported and passed and have medicare under social security it would be a great day for the people of our country nearly every home has some father or mother or uncle or aunt or some member of their family that finds need for medical care insurance too many of them don t have it and never will have it under the present system we have i think the poverty bill is very important all the cabinet members have testified on it secretary mcnamara the attorney general the secretary of labor the secretary of health education and welfare the secretary of agriculture we are all united we think that it is a comprehensive bill and has very sound principles it will do a lot to help us with our juvenile delinquency problem it will take our boys off the streets and out of the alleys and out of the pool rooms it will make it possible for us to train and educate people for national service that are now being turned back by the draft we think that bill is soundly conceived and very important so i would list just those four or five the pay bill the poverty bill the medicare bill the civil rights bill the food stamp bill as five i should hope would be passed before the convention q mr president sir i wonder what you think about some of our columnists and fellow correspondents who have been writing declassified material given to them obviously by some officers in the national security council and in the pentagon i refer to the material about macarthur and his command in korea i am sure that it was necessary to classify this material but i wonder why it is declassified at this time for just certain ones the president i raised that question with the pentagon today at lunch and they tell me they are unaware of any of the material relating to general macarthur that had not already been published in books prior to the recent revelation q mr president sir in the light of your unequivocal stand on civil rights are you concerned about the election in november of independent electors in the southern states that would be committed to vote neither for you nor for your republican opponent the president yes i would always be concerned about any elector that was not committed to vote for me if i were a candidate and i would do my best to convince him of the error of his ways i don t anticipate however that there will be any substantial number that will feel that the future of this country should be placed in the hands of independent electors but i think most of them will be associated with one of the two regular parties the democratic party and the republican party q mr president since the maryland presidential primary is not exactly a contest between maryland democrats don t you think you might say something or do something to try to affect that result the president i gave serious consideration to what my policies should be in connection with primaries many years ago generally speaking there could be an exception but generally speaking i think it is unwise for me to interfere in primaries or attempt to influence people in primaries in connection with the presidential primaries this year which is much more specific than my previous statement which applies to all primaries i gave thought to what my course of conduct should be and concluded that i would not enter any primaries i would do the very best job i could as president for all the people up until convention time and then let the delegates at the convention make their choice freely then my conduct would be determined after they made their choice thank you mr president

this campaign now draws near a close the platforms of the two parties defining principles and offering solutions of various national problems have been presented and are being earnestly considered by our people after four months debate it is not the republican party which finds reason for abandonment of any of the principles it has laid down or of the views it has expressed for solution of the problems before the country the principles to which it adheres are rooted deeply in the foundations of our national life the solutions which it proposes are based on experience with government and on a consciousness that it may have the responsibility for placing those solutions in action in my acceptance speech i endeavored to outline the spirit and ideals by which i would be guided in carrying that platform into administration tonight i will not deal with the multitude of issues which have been already well canvassed i intend rather to discuss some of those more fundamental principles and ideals upon which i believe the government of the united states should be conducted the republican party has ever been a party of progress i do not need to review its seventy years of constructive history it has always reflected the spirit of the american people never has it done more for the advancement of fundamental progress than during the past seven and a half years since we took over the government amidst the ruin left by war it detracts nothing from the character and energy of the american people it minimizes in no degree the quality of their accomplishments to say that the policies of the republican party have played a large part in recuperation from the war and the building of the magnificent progress which shows upon every hand today i say with emphasis that without the wise policies which the republican party has brought into action during this period no such progress would have been possible the first responsibility of the republican administration was to renew the march of progress from its collapse by the war that task involved the restoration of confidence in the future and the liberation and stimulation of the constructive energies of our people it discharged that task there is not a person within the sound of my voice that does not know the profound progress which our country has made in this period every man and woman knows that american comfort hope and confidence for the future are immeasurably higher this day than they were seven and one half years ago it is not my purpose to enter upon a detailed recital of the great constructive measures of the past seven and a half years by which this has been brought about it is sufficient to remind you of the restoration of employment to the millions who walked your streets in idleness to remind you of the creation of the budget system the reduction of six billions of national debt which gave the powerful impulse of that vast sum returned to industry and commerce the four sequent reductions of taxes and thereby the lift to the living of every family the enactment of adequate protective tariff and immigration laws which have safeguarded our workers and farmers from floods of goods and labor from foreign countries the creation of credit facilities and many other aids to agriculture the building up of foreign trade the care of veterans the development of aviation of radio of our inland waterways of our highways the expansion of scientific research of welfare activities the making of safer highways safer mines better homes the spread of outdoor recreation the improvement in public health and the care of children and a score of other progressive actions nor do i need to remind you that government today deals with an economic and social system vastly more intricate and delicately adjusted than ever before that system now must be kept in perfect tune if we would maintain uninterrupted employment and the high standards of living of our people the government has come to touch this delicate web at a thousand points yearly the relations of government to national prosperity become more and more intimate only through keen vision and helpful cooperation by the government has stability in business and stability in employment been maintained during this past seven and a half years there always are some localities some industries and some individuals who do not share the prevailing prosperity the task of government is to lessen these inequalities never has there been a period when the federal government has given such aid and impulse to the progress of our people not alone to economic progress but to the development of those agencies which make for moral and spiritual progress but in addition to this great record of contributions of the republican party to progress there has been a further fundamental contribution a contribution underlying and sustaining all the others and that is the resistance of the republican party to every attempt to inject the government into business in competition with its citizens after the war when the republican party assumed administration of the country we were faced with the problem of determination of the very nature of our national life during 150 years we have builded up a form of self government and a social system which is peculiarly our own it differs essentially from all others in the world it is the american system it is just as definite and positive a political and social system as has ever been developed on earth it is founded upon a particular conception of self government in which decentralized local responsibility is the very base further than this it is founded upon the conception that only through ordered liberty freedom and equal opportunity to the individual will his initiative and enterprise spur on the march of progress and in our insistence upon equality of opportunity has our system advanced beyond all the world during the war we necessarily turned to the government to solve every difficult economic problem the government having absorbed every energy of our people for war there was no other solution for the preservation of the state the federal government became a centralized despotism which undertook unprecedented responsibilities assumed autocratic powers and took over the business of citizens to a large degree we regimented our whole people temporarily into a socialistic state however justified in time of war if continued in peace time it would destroy not only our american system but with it our progress and freedom as well when the war closed the most vital of all issues both in our own country and throughout the world was whether governments should continue their wartime ownership and operation of many instrumentalities of production and distribution we were challenged with a peace time choice between the american system of rugged individualism and a european philosophy of diametrically opposed doctrines doctrines of paternalism and state socialism the acceptance of these ideas would have meant the destruction of self government through centralization of government it would have meant the undermining of the individual initiative and enterprise through which our people have grown to unparalleled greatness the republican party from the beginning resolutely turned its face away from these ideas and these war practices a republican congress cooperated with the democratic administration to demobilize many of our war activities at that time the two parties were accord upon that point when the republican party came into full power it went at once resolutely back to our fundamental conception of the state and the rights and responsibilities of the individual thereby it restored confidence and hope in the american people it freed and stimulated enterprise it restored the government to its position as an umpire instead of a player in the economic game for these reasons the american people have gone forward in progress while the rest of the world has halted and some countries have even gone backwards if anyone will study the causes of retarded recuperation in europe he will find much of it due to the stifling of private initiative on one hand and overloading of the government with business on the other there has been revived in this campaign however a series of proposals which if adopted would be a long step toward the abandonment of our american system and a surrender to the destructive operation of governmental conduct of commercial business because the country is faced with difficulty and doubt over certain national problems that is prohibition farm relief and electrical power our opponents propose that we must thrust government a long way into the businesses which give rise to these problems in effect they abandon the tenets of their own party and turn to state socialism as a solution for the difficulties presented by all three it is proposed that we shall change from prohibition to the state purchase and sale of liquor if their agricultural relief program means anything it means that the government shall directly or indirectly buy and sell and fix prices of agricultural products and we are to go into the hydroelectric power business in other words we are confronted with a huge program of government in business there is therefore submitted to the american people a question of fundamental principle that is shall we depart from the principles of our american political and economic system upon which we have advanced beyond all the rest of the world in order to adopt methods based on principles destructive of its very foundations and i wish to emphasize the seriousness of these proposals i wish to make my position clear for this goes to the very roots of american life and progress i should like to state to you the effect that this projection of government in business would have upon our system of self government and our economic system that effect would reach to the daily life of every man and woman it would impair the very basis of liberty and freedom not only for those left outside the fold of expanded bureaucracy but for those embraced within it let us first see the effect upon self government when the federal government undertakes to go into commercial business it must at once set up the organization and administration of that business and it immediately finds itself in a labyrinth every alley of which leads to the destruction of self government commercial business requires a concentration of responsibility self government requires decentralization and many checks and balances to safeguard liberty our government to succeed in business would need become in effect a despotism there at once begins the destruction of self government the first problem of the government about to adventure in commercial business is to determine a method of administration it must secure leadership and direction shall this leadership be chosen by political agencies or shall we make it elective the hard practical fact is that leadership in business must come through the sheer rise in ability and character that rise can only take place in the free atmosphere of competition competition is closed by bureaucracy political agencies are feeble channels through which to select able leaders to conduct commercial business government in order to avoid the possible incompetence corruption and tyranny of too great authority in individuals entrusted with commercial business inevitably turns to boards and commissions to make sure that there are checks and balances each member of such boards and commissions must have equal authority each has his separate responsibility to the public and at once we have the conflict of ideas and the lack of decision which would ruin any commercial business it has contributed greatly to the demoralization of our shipping business moreover these commissions must be representative of different sections and different political parties so that at once we have an entire blight upon coordinated action within their ranks which destroys any possibility of effective administration moreover our legislative bodies cannot in fact delegate their full authority to commissions or to individuals for the conduct of matters vital to the american people for if we would preserve government by the people we must preserve the authority of our legislators in the activities of our government thus every time the federal government goes into a commercial business 531 senators and congressmen become the actual board of directors of that business every time a state government goes into business one or two hundred state senators and legislators become the actual directors of that business even if they were supermen and if there were no politics in the united states no body of such numbers could competently direct commercial activities for that requires initiative instant decision and action it took congress six years of constant discussion to even decide what the method of administration of muscle shoals should be when the federal government undertakes to go into business the state governments are at once deprived of control and taxation of that business when a state government undertakes to go into business it at once deprives the municipalities of taxation and control of that business municipalities being local and close to the people can at times succeed in business where federal and state governments must fail we have trouble enough with log rolling in legislative bodies today it originates naturally from desires of citizens to advance their particular section or to secure some necessary service it would be multiplied a thousandfold were the federal and state governments in these businesses the effect upon our economic progress would be even worse business progressiveness is dependent on competition new methods and new ideas are the outgrowth of the spirit of adventure of individual initiative and of individual enterprise without adventure there is no progress no government administration can rightly take chances with taxpayers money there is no better example of the practical incompetence of government to conduct business than the history of our railways during the war the government found it necessary to operate the railways that operation continued until after the war in the year before being freed from government operation they were not able to meet the demands for transportation eight years later we find them under private enterprise transporting 15 per cent more goods and meeting every demand for service rates have been reduced by 15 per cent and net earnings increased from less than 1 per cent on their valuation to about 5 per cent wages of employees have improved by 13 per cent the wages of railway employees are today 121 per cent above pre war while the wages of government employees are today only 65 per cent above pre war that should be a sufficient commentary upon the efficiency of government operation let us now examine this question from the point of view of the person who may get a government job and is admitted into the new bureaucracy upon that subject let me quote from a speech of that great leader of labor samuel gompers delivered in montreal in 1920 a few years before his death he said i believe there is no man to whom i would take second position in my loyalty to the republic of the united states and yet i would not give it more power over the individual citizenship of our country it is a question of whether it shall be government ownership or private ownership under control if i were in the minority of one in this convention i would want to cast my vote so that the men of labor shall not willingly enslave themselves to government authority in their industrial effort for freedom let the future tell the story of who is right or who is wrong who has stood for freedom and who has been willing to submit their fate industrially to the government i would amplify mr gompers statement the great body of government employees which would be created by the proposals of our opponents would either comprise a political machine at the disposal of the party in power or alternatively to prevent this the government by stringent civil service rules must debar its employees from their full political rights as free men it must limit them in the liberty to bargain for their own wages for no government employee can strike against his government and thus against the whole people it makes a legislative body with all its political currents their final employer and master their bargaining does not rest upon economic need or economic strength but on political potence but what of those who are outside the bureaucracy what is the effect upon their lives the area of enterprise and opportunity for them to strive and rise is at once limited the government in commercial business does not tolerate amongst its customers the freedom of competitive reprisals to which private business is subject bureaucracy does not tolerate the spirit of independence it spreads the spirit of submission into our daily life and penetrates the temper of our people not with the habit of powerful resistance to wrong but with the habit of timid acceptance of irresistible might bureaucracy is ever desirous of spreading its influence and its power you cannot extend the mastery of the government over the daily working life of a people without at the same time making it the master of the people s souls and thoughts every expansion of government in business means that government in order to protect itself from the political consequences of its errors and wrongs is driven irresistibly without peace to greater and greater control of the nations press and platform free speech does not live many hours after free industry and free commerce die it is a false liberalism that interprets itself into the government operation of commercial business every step of bureaucratizing of the business of our country poisons the very roots of liberalism that is political equality free speech free assembly free press and equality of opportunity it is the road not to more liberty but to less liberty liberalism should be found not striving to spread bureaucracy but striving to set bounds to it true liberalism seeks all legitimate freedom first in the confident belief that without such freedom the pursuit of all other blessings and benefits is vain that belief is the foundation of all american progress political as well as economic liberalism is a force truly of the spirit a force proceeding from the deep realization that economic freedom cannot be sacrificed if political freedom is to be preserved even if governmental conduct of business could give us more efficiency instead of less efficiency the fundamental objection to it would remain unaltered and unabated it would destroy political equality it would increase rather than decrease abuse and corruption it would stifle initiative and invention it would undermine the development of leadership it would cramp and cripple the mental and spiritual energies of our people it would extinguish equality and opportunity it would dry up the spirit of liberty and progress for these reasons primarily it must be resisted for a hundred and fifty years liberalism has found its true spirit in the american system not in the european systems i do not wish to be misunderstood in this statement i am defining a general policy it does not mean that our government is to part with one iota of its national resources without complete protection to the public interest i have already stated that where the government is engaged in public works for purposes of flood control of navigation of irrigation of scientific research or national defense or in pioneering a new art it will at times necessarily produce power or commodities as a by product but they must be a by product of the major purpose not the major purpose itself nor do i wish to be misinterpreted as believing that the united states is free for all and devil take the hind most the very essence of equality of opportunity and of american individualism is that there shall be no domination by any group or combination in this republic whether it be business or political on the contrary it demands economic justice as well as political and social justice it is no system of laissez faire i feel deeply on this subject because during the war i had some practical experience with governmental operation and control i have witnessed not only at home but abroad the many failures of government in business i have seen its tyrannies its injustices its destructions of self government its undermining of the very instincts which carry our people forward to progress i have witnessed the lack of advance the lowered standards of living the depressed spirits of people working under such a system my objection is based not upon theory or upon a failure to recognize wrong or abuse but i know the adoption of such methods would strike at the very roots of american life and would destroy the very basis of american progress our people have the right to know whether we can continue to solve our great problems without abandonment of our american system i know we can we have demonstrated that our system is responsive enough to meet any new and intricate development in our economic and business life we have demonstrated that we can meet any economic problem and still maintain our democracy as master in its own house and that we can at the same time preserve equality of opportunity and individual freedom in the last fifty years we have discovered that mass production will produce articles for us at half the cost they required previously we have seen the resultant growth of large units of production and distribution this is big business many businesses must be bigger for our tools are bigger our country is bigger we now build a single dynamo of a hundred thousand horsepower even fifteen years ago that would have been a big business all by itself yet today advance in production requires that we set ten of these units together in a row the american people from bitter experience have a rightful fear that great business units might be used to dominate our industrial life and by illegal and unethical practices destroy equality of opportunity years ago the republican administration established the principle that such evils could be corrected by regulation it developed methods by which abuses could be prevented while the full value of industrial progress could be retained for the public it insisted upon the principle that when great public utilities were clothed with the security of partial monopoly whether it be railways power plants telephones or what not then there must be the fullest and most complete control of rates services and finances by government or local agencies it declared that these businesses must be conducted with glass pockets as to our great manufacturing and distributing industries the republican party insisted up on the enactment of laws that not only would maintain competition but would destroy conspiracies to destroy the smaller units or dominate and limit the equality of opportunity amongst our people one of the great problems of government is to determine to what extent the government shall regulate and control commerce and industry and how much it shall leave it alone no system is perfect we have had many abuses in the private conduct of business that every good citizen resents it is just as important that business keep out of government as that government keep out of business nor am i setting up the contention that our institutions are perfect no human ideal is ever perfectly attained since humanity itself is not perfect the wisdom of our forefathers in their conception that progress can only be attained as the sum of the accomplishment of free individuals has been re enforced by all of the great leaders of the country since that day jackson lincoln cleveland mckinley roosevelt wilson and coolidge have stood unalterably for these principles and what have been the results of our american system our country has become the land of opportunity to those born without inheritance not merely because of the wealth of its resources and industry but because of this freedom of initiative and enterprise russia has natural resources equal to ours her people are equally industrious but she has not had the blessings of 150 years of our form of government and of our social system by adherence to the principles of decentralized self government ordered liberty equal opportunity and freedom to the individual our american experiment in human welfare has yielded a degree of well being unparalleled in all the world it has come nearer to the abolition of poverty to the abolition of fear of want than humanity has ever reached before progress of the past seven years is the proof of it this alone furnishes the answer to our opponents who ask us to introduce destructive elements into the system by which this has been accomplished let us see what this system has done for us in our recent years of difficult and trying reconstruction and let us then solemnly ask ourselves if we now wish to abandon it as a nation we came out of the war with great losses we made no profits from it the apparent increases in wages were at that time fictitious we were poorer as a nation when we emerged from the war yet during these last eight years we have recovered from these losses and increased our national income by over one third even if we discount the inflation of the dollar that there has been a wide diffusion of our gain in wealth and income is marked by a hundred proofs i know of no better test of the improved conditions of the average family than the combined increase in assets of life and industrial insurance building and loan associations and savings deposits these are the savings banks of the average man these agencies alone have in seven years increased by nearly 100 per cent to the gigantic sum of over 50 billions of dollars or nearly one sixth of our whole national wealth we have increased in home ownership we have expanded the investments of the average man in addition t o these evidences of larger savings our people are steadily increasing their spending for higher standards of living today there are almost 9 automobiles for each 10 families where seven and a half years ago only enough automobiles were running to average less than 4 for each 10 families the slogan of progress is changing from the full dinner pail to the full garage our people have more to eat better things to wear and better homes we have even gained in elbow room for the increase of residential floor space is over 25 per cent with less than 10 per cent increase in our number of people wages have increased the cost of living has decreased the job to every man and woman has been made more secure we have in this short period decreased the fear of poverty the fear of unemployment the fear of old age and these are fears that are the greatest calamities of human kind all this progress means far more than greater creature comforts it finds a thousand interpretations into a greater and fuller life a score of new helps save the drudgery of the home in seven years we have added 70 per cent to the electric power at the elbow of our workers and further promoted them from carriers of burdens to directors of machines we have steadily reduced the sweat in human labor our hours of labor are lessened our leisure has increased we have expanded our parks and playgrounds we have nearly doubled our attendance at games we pour into outdoor recreation in every direction the visitors at our national parks have trebled and we have so increased the number of sportsmen fishing in our streams and lakes that the longer time between bites is becoming a political issue in these seven and one half years the radio has brought music and laughter education and political discussion to almost every fireside springing from our prosperity with its greater freedom its vast endowment of scientific research and the greater resources with which to care for public health we have according to our insurance actuaries during this short period since the war lengthened the average span of life by nearly eight years we have reduced infant mortality we have vastly decreased the days of illness and suffering in the life of every man and woman we have improved the facilities for the care of the crippled and helpless and deranged from our increasing resources we have expanded our educational system in eight years from an outlay of 1 200 millions to 2 700 millions of dollars the education of our youth has become almost our largest and certainly our most important activity from our greater income and thus our ability to free youth from toil we have increased the attendance in our grade schools by 14 per cent in our high schools by 80 per cent and in our institutions of higher learning by 95 per cent today we have more youth in these institutions of higher learning twice over than all the rest of the world put together we have made notable progress in literature in art and in public taste we have made progress in the leadership of every branch of american life never in our history was the leadership in our economic life more distinguished in its abilities than today and it has grown greatly in its consciousness of public responsibility leadership in our professions and in moral and spiritual affairs of our country was never of a higher order and our magnificent educational system is bringing forward a host of recruits for the succession to this leadership i do not need to recite more figures and more evidence i cannot believe that the american people wish to abandon or in any way to weaken the principles of economic freedom and self government which have been maintained by the republican party and which have produced results so amazing and so stimulating to the spiritual as well as to the material advance of the nation your city has been an outstanding beneficiary of this great progress and of these safeguarded principles with its suburbs it has during the last seven and a half years grown by over a million and a half of people until it has become the largest metropolitan district of all the world here you have made abundant opportunity not only for the youth of the land but for the immigrant from foreign shores this city is the commercial center of the united states it is the commercial agent of the american people it is a great organism of specialized skill and leadership in finance industry and commerce which reaches every spot in our country its progress and its beauty are the pride of the whole american people it leads our nation in its benevolences to charity to education and scientific research it is the center of art music literature and drama it has come to have a more potent voice than any other city in the united states but when all is said and done the very life progress and prosperity of this city is wholly dependent on the prosperity of the 115 000 000 people who dwell in our mountains and valleys across the 3 000 miles to the pacific ocean every activity of this city is sensitive to every evil and every favorable tide that sweeps this great nation of ours be there a slackening of industry in any place it affects new york far more than any other part of the country in a time of depression one quarter of all the unemployed in the united states can be numbered in this city in a time of prosperity the citizens of the great interior of our country pour into your city for business and entertainment at the rate of 150 000 a day in fact so much is this city the reflex of the varied interests of our country that the concern of everyone of your citizens for national stability for national prosperity for national progress for preservation of our american system is far greater than that of any other single part of our country we still have great problems if we would achieve the full economic advancement of our country in these past few years some groups in our country have lagged behind others in the march of progress i refer more particularly to those engaged in the textile coal and in the agricultural industries we can assist in solving these problems by cooperation of our government to the agricultural industry we shall need to advance initial capital to assist them to stabilize their industry but this proposal implies that they shall conduct it themselves and not by the government it is in the interest of our cities that we shall bring agriculture and all industries into full stability and prosperity i know you will gladly cooperate in the faith that in the common prosperity of our country lies its future in bringing this address to a conclusion i should like to restate to you some of the fundamental things i have endeavored to bring out the foundations of progress and prosperity are dependent as never before upon the wise policies of government for government now touches at a thousand points the intricate web of economic and social life under administration by the republican party in the last 7 1 2 years our country as a whole has made unparalleled progress and this has been in generous part reflected to this great city prosperity is no idle expression it is a job for every worker it is the safety and the safeguard of every business and every home a continuation of the policies of the republican party is fundamentally necessary to the further advancement of this progress and to the further building up of this prosperity i have dwelt at some length on the principles of relationship between the government and business i make no apologies for dealing with this subject the first necessity of any nation is the smooth functioning of the vast business machinery for employment feeding clothing housing and providing luxuries and comforts to a people unless these basic elements are properly organized and function there can be no progress in business in education literature music or art there can be no advance in the fundamental ideals of a people a people cannot make progress in poverty i have endeavored to present to you that the greatness of america has grown out of a political and social system and a method of control of economic forces distinctly its own our american system which has carried this great experiment in human welfare farther than ever before in all history we are nearer today to the ideal of the abolition of poverty and fear from the lives of men and women than ever before in any land and i again repeat that the departure from our american system by injecting principles destructive to it which our opponents propose will jeopardize the very liberty and freedom of our people will destroy equality of opportunity not alone to ourselves but to our children to me the foundation of american life rests upon the home and the family i read into these great economic forces these intricate and delicate relations of the government with business and with our political and social life but one supreme end that we reinforce the ties that bind together the millions of our families that we strengthen the security the happiness and the independence of every home my conception of america is a land where men and women may walk in ordered freedom in the independent conduct of their occupations where they may enjoy the advantages of wealth not concentrated in the hands of the few but spread through the lives of all where they build and safeguard their homes and give to their children the fullest advantages and opportunities of american life where every man shall be respected in the faith that his conscience and his heart direct him to follow where a contented and happy people secure in their liberties free from poverty and fear shall have the leisure and impulse to seek a fuller life some may ask where all this may lead beyond mere material progress it leads to a release of the energies of men and women from the dull drudgery of life to a wider vision and a higher hope it leads to the opportunity for greater and greater service not alone from man to man in our own land but from our country to the whole world it leads to an america healthy in body healthy in spirit unfettered youthful eager with a vision searching beyond the farthest horizons with an open mind sympathetic and generous it is to these higher ideals and for these purposes that i pledge myself and the republican party

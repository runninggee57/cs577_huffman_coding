the president this morning at 7 a m the union representing those who man america s air traffic control facilities called a strike this was the culmination of 7 months of negotiations between the federal aviation administration and the union at one point in these negotiations agreement was reached and signed by both sides granting a 40 million increase in salaries and benefits this is twice what other government employees can expect it was granted in recognition of the difficulties inherent in the work these people perform now however the union demands are 17 times what had been agreed to 681 million this would impose a tax burden on their fellow citizens which is unacceptable i would like to thank the supervisors and controllers who are on the job today helping to get the nation s air system operating safely in the new york area for example four supervisors were scheduled to report for work and 17 additionally volunteered at national airport a traffic controller told a newsperson he had resigned from the union and reported to work because how can i ask my kids to obey the law if i don t this is a great tribute to america let me make one thing plain i respect the right of workers in the private sector to strike indeed as president of my own union i led the first strike ever called by that union i guess i m maybe the first one to ever hold this office who is a lifetime member of an afl cio union but we cannot compare labor management relations in the private sector with government government cannot close down the assembly line it has to provide without interruption the protective services which are government s reason for being it was in recognition of this that the congress passed a law forbidding strikes by government employees against the public safety let me read the solemn oath taken by each of these employees a sworn affidavit when they accepted their jobs i am not participating in any strike against the government of the united states or any agency thereof and i will not so participate while an employee of the government of the united states or any agency thereof it is for this reason that i must tell those who fail to report for duty this morning they are in violation of the law and if they do not report for work within 48 hours they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated q mr president are you going to order any union members who violate the law to go to jail the president well i have some people around here and maybe i should refer that question to the attorney general q do you think that they should go to jail mr president anybody who violates this law the president i told you what i think should be done they re terminated the attorney general well as the president has said striking under these circumstances constitutes a violation of the law and we intend to initiate in appropriate cases criminal proceedings against those who have violated the law q how quickly will you initiate criminal proceedings mr attorney general the attorney general we will initiate those proceedings as soon as we can q today the attorney general the process will be underway probably by noon today q are you going to try and fine the union 1 million per day the attorney general well that s the prerogative of the court in the event that any individuals are found guilty of contempt of a court order the penalty for that of course is imposed by the court q how much more is the government prepared to offer the union the secretary of transportation we think we had a very satisfactory offer on the table it s twice what other government employees are going to get 11 4 percent their demands were so unreasonable there was no spot to negotiate when you re talking to somebody 17 times away from where you presently are we do not plan to increase our offer to the union q under no circumstances the secretary of transportation as far as i m concerned under no circumstance q will you continue to meet with them the secretary of transportation we will not meet with the union as long as they re on strike when they re off of strike and assuming that they are not decertified we will meet with the union and try to negotiate a satisfactory contract q do you have any idea how it s going at the airports around the country the secretary of transportation relatively it s going quite well we re operating somewhat in excess of 50 percent capacity we could increase that we have determined until we feel we re in total control of the system that we will not increase that also as you probably know we have some rather severe weather in the midwest and our first priority is safety q what can you tell us about possible decertification of the union and impoundment of its strike funds the secretary of transportation there has been a court action to impound the strike fund of 3 5 million we are going before the national labor relations authority this morning and ask for decertification of the union q when you say that you re not going to increase your offer are you referring to the original offer or the last offer which you ve made is that still valid the secretary of transportation the last offer we made in present value was exactly the same as the first offer mr poli asked me about 11 o clock last evening if he could phase the increase in over a period of time for that reason we phased it in over a longer period of time it would have given him a larger increase in terms of where he would be when the next negotiations started but in present value it was the 40 million originally on the table q mr attorney general in seeking criminal action against the union leaders will you seek to put them in jail if they do not order these people back to work the attorney general well we will seek whatever penalty is appropriate under the circumstances in each individual case q do you think that is an appropriate circumstance the attorney general it is certainly one of the penalties that is provided for in the law and in appropriate cases we could very well seek that penalty q what s appropriate the attorney general well that depends upon the fact of each case q what makes the difference q can i go back to my fine question how much would you like to see the union fined every day the attorney general well there s no way to answer that question we would just have to wait until we get into court see what the circumstances are and determine what position we would take in the various cases under the facts as they develop q but you won t go to court and ask the court for a specific amount the attorney general well i m sure we will when we reach that point but there s no way to pick a figure now q mr president will you delay your trip to california or cancel it if the strike is still on later this week the president if any situation should arise that would require my presence here naturally i will do that so that will be a decision that awaits what s going to happen may i just because i have to be back in there for another appointment may i just say one thing on top of this with all this talk of penalties and everything else i hope that you ll emphasize again the possibility of termination because i believe that there are a great many of those people and they re fine people who have been swept up in this and probably have not really considered the result the fact that they had taken an oath the fact that this is now in violation of the law as that one supervisor referred to with regard to his children and i am hoping that they will in a sense remove themselves from the lawbreaker situation by returning to their posts i have no way to know whether this had been conveyed to them by their union leaders who had been informed that this would be the result of a strike q your deadline is 7 o clock wednesday morning for them to return to work the president forty eight hours the secretary of transportation it s 11 o clock wednesday morning q mr president why have you taken such strong action as your first action why not some lesser action at this point the president what lesser action can there be the law is very explicit they are violating the law and as i say we called this to the attention of their leadership whether this was conveyed to the membership before they voted to strike i don t know but this is one of the reasons why there can be no further negotiation while this situation continues you can t sit and negotiate with a union that s in violation of the law the secretary of transportation and their oath the president and their oath q are you more likely to proceed in the criminal direction toward the leadership than the rank and file mr president the president well that again is not for me to answer q mr secretary what can you tell us about the possible use of military air controllers how many how quickly can they get on the job the secretary of transportation in answer to the previous question we will move both civil and criminal probably more civil than criminal and we now have papers in the u s attorneys offices under the attorney general in about 20 locations around the country where would be involved two or three principal people as far as the military personnel are concerned they are going to fundamentally be backup to the supervisory personnel we had 150 on the job supposedly about a half hour ago we re going to increase that to somewhere between 700 and 850 q mr secretary are you ready to hire other people should these other people not return the secretary of transportation yes we will and we hope we do not reach that point again as the president said we re hoping these people come back to work they do a fine job if that does not take place we have a training school as you know we will be advertising we have a number of applicants right now there s a waiting list in terms of people that want to be controllers and we ll start retraining and reorganize the entire faa traffic controller group q just to clarify is your deadline 7 a m wednesday or 11 o clock the secretary of transportation it s 11 a m wednesday the president said 48 hours and that would be 48 hours q if you actually fire these people won t it put your air traffic control system in a hole for years to come since you can t just cook up a controller in inaudible the secretary of transportation that obviously depends on how many return to work right now we re able to operate the system in some areas we ve been very gratified by the support we ve received in other areas we ve been disappointed and until i see the numbers there s no way i can answer that question q mr lewis did you tell the union leadership when you were talking to them that their members would be fired if they went out on strike the secretary of transportation i told mr poll yesterday that the president gave me three instructions in terms of the firmness of the negotiations one is there would be no amnesty the second there would be no negotiations during the strike and third is that if they went on strike these people would no longer be government employees q mr secretary you said no negotiations what about informal meetings of any kind with mr poli the secretary of transportation we will have no meetings until the strike is terminated with the union q have you served poli at this point has he been served by the attorney general the attorney general in the civil action that was filed this morning the service was made on the attorney for the union and the court has determined that that was appropriate service on all of the officers of the union q my previous question about whether you re going to take a harder line on the leadership than rank and file in terms of any criminal prosecution can you give us an answer on that the attorney general no i can t answer that except to say that each case will be investigated on its own merits and action will be taken as appropriate in each of those cases q mr lewis do you know how many applications for controller jobs you have on file now the secretary of transportation i do not know i m going to check when i get back i am aware there s a waiting list and i do not have the figure if you care to have that you can call our office and we ll tell you also we ll be advertising and recruiting people for this job if necessary q mr secretary how long are you prepared to hold out if there s a partial but not complete strike the secretary of transportation i think the president made it very clear that as of 48 hours from now if the people are not back on the job they will not be government employees at any time in the future q how long are you prepared to run the air controller system inaudible the secretary of transportation for years if we have to q how long does it take to train a new controller from the waiting list the secretary of transportation it varies it depends on the type of center they re going to be in for someone to start in the system and work through the more minor office types of control situations till they get to let s say a chicago or a washington national it takes about 3 years so in this case what we ll have to do if some of the major metropolitan areas are shut down or a considerable portion is shut down we ll be bringing people in from other areas that are qualified and then start bringing people through the training schools in the smaller cities and smaller airports q mr secretary have you definitely made your final offer to the union the secretary of transportation yes we have q thank you

good evening seven weeks ago tonight i returned from europe to report on my meeting with premier khrushchev and the others his grim warnings about the future of the world his aide memoire on berlin his subsequent speeches and threats which he and his agents have launched and the increase in the soviet military budget that he has announced have all prompted a series of decisions by the administration and a series of consultations with the members of the nato organization in berlin as you recall he intends to bring to an end through a stroke of the pen first our legal rights to be in west berlin and secondly our ability to make good on our commitment to the two million free people of that city that we cannot permit we are clear about what must be done and we intend to do it i want to talk frankly with you tonight about the first steps that we shall take these actions will require sacrifice on the part of many of our citizens more will be required in the future they will require from all of us courage and perseverance in the years to come but if we and our allies act out of strength and unity of purpose with calm determination and steady nerves using restraint in our words as well as our weapons i am hopeful that both peace and freedom will be sustained the immediate threat to free men is in west berlin but that isolated outpost is not an isolated problem the threat is worldwide our effort must be equally wide and strong and not be obsessed by any single manufactured crisis we face a challenge in berlin but there is also a challenge in southeast asia where the borders are less guarded the enemy harder to find and the dangers of communism less apparent to those who have so little we face a challenge in our own hemisphere and indeed wherever else the freedom of human beings is at stake let me remind you that the fortunes of war and diplomacy left the free people of west berlin in 1945 110 miles behind the iron curtain this map makes very dear the problem that we face the white is west germany the east is the area controlled by the soviet union and as you can see from the chart west berlin is 110 miles within the area which the soviets now dominate which is immediately controlled by the so called east german regime we are there as a result of our victory over nazi germany and our basic rights to be there deriving from that victory include both our presence in west berlin and the enjoyment of access across east germany these rights have been repeatedly confirmed and recognized in special agreements with the soviet union berlin is not a part of east germany but a separate territory under the control of the allied powers thus our rights there are clear and deep rooted but in addition to those rights is our commitment to sustain and defend if need be the opportunity for more than two million people to determine their own future and choose their own way of life thus our presence in west berlin and our access thereto cannot be ended by any act of the soviet government the nato shield was long ago extended to cover west berlin and we have given our word that an attack upon that city will be regarded as an attack upon us all for west berlin lying exposed 110 miles inside east germany surrounded by soviet troops and close to soviet supply lines has many roles it is more than a showcase of liberty a symbol an island of freedom in a communist sea it is even more than a link with the free world a beacon of hope behind the iron curtain an escape hatch for refugees west berlin is all of that but above all it has now become as never before the great testing place of western courage and will a focal point where our solemn commitments stretching back over the years since 1945 and soviet ambitions now meet in basic confrontation it would be a mistake for others to look upon berlin because of its location as a tempting target the united states is there the united kingdom and france are there the pledge of nato is there and the people of berlin are there it is as secure in that sense as the rest of us for we cannot separate its safety from our own i hear it said that west berlin is militarily untenable and so was bastogne and so in fact was stalingrad any dangerous spot is tenable if men brave men will make it so we do not want to fight but we have fought before and others in earlier times have made the same dangerous mistake of assuming that the west was too selfish and too soft and too divided to resist invasions of freedom in other lands those who threaten to unleash the forces of war on a dispute over west berlin should recall the words of the ancient philosopher a man who causes fear cannot be free from fear we cannot and will not permit the communists to drive us out of berlin either gradually or by force for the fulfillment of our pledge to that city is essential to the morale and security of western germany to the unity of western europe and to the faith of the entire free world soviet strategy has long been aimed not merely at berlin but at dividing and neutralizing all of europe forcing us back on our own shores we must meet our oft stated pledge to the free peoples of west berlin and maintain our rights and their safety even in the face of force in order to maintain the confidence of other free peoples in our word and our resolve the strength of the alliance on which our security depends is dependent in turn on our willingness to meet our commitments to them so long as the communists insist that they are preparing to end by themselves unilaterally our rights in west berlin and our commitments to its people we must be prepared to defend those rights and those commitments we will at all times be ready to talk if talk will help but we must also be ready to resist with force if force is used upon us either alone would fail together they can serve the cause of freedom and peace the new preparations that we shall make to defend the peace are part of the long term build up in our strength which has been underway since january they are based on our needs to meet a world wide threat on a basis which stretches far beyond the present berlin crisis our primary purpose is neither propaganda nor provocation but preparation a first need is to hasten progress toward the military goals which the north atlantic allies have set for themselves in europe today nothing less will suffice we will put even greater resources into fulfilling those goals and we look to our allies to do the same the supplementary defense build ups that i asked from the congress in march and may have already started moving us toward these and our other defense goals they included an increase in the size of the marine corps improved readiness of our reserves expansion of our air and sea lift and stepped up procurement of needed weapons ammunition and other items to insure a continuing invulnerable capacity to deter or destroy any aggressor they provided for the strengthening of our missile power and for putting 50 of our b 52 and b 47 bombers on a ground alert which would send them on their way with 15 minutes warning these measures must be speeded up and still others must now be taken we must have sea and air lift capable of moving our forces quickly and in large numbers to any part of the world but even more importantly we need the capability of placing in any critical area at the appropriate time a force which combined with those of our allies is large enough to make clear our determination and our ability to defend our rights at all costs and to meet all levels of aggressor pressure with whatever levels of force are required we intend to have a wider choice than humiliation or all out nuclear action while it is unwise at this time either to call up or send abroad excessive numbers of these troops before they are needed let me make it clear that i intend to take as time goes on whatever steps are necessary to make certain that such forces can be deployed at the appropriate time without lessening our ability to meet our commitments elsewhere thus in the days and months ahead i shall not hesitate to ask the congress for additional measures or exercise any of the executive powers that i possess to meet this threat to peace everything essential to the security of freedom must be done and if that should require more men or more taxes or more controls or other new powers i shall not hesitate to ask them the measures proposed today will be constantly studied and altered as necessary but while we will not let panic shape our policy neither will we permit timidity to direct our program accordingly i am now taking the following steps 1 i am tomorrow requesting the congress for the current fiscal year an additional 3 247 000 000 of appropriations for the armed forces 2 to fill out our present army divisions and to make more men available for prompt deployment i am requesting an increase in the army s total authorized strength from 875 000 to approximately 1 million men 3 i am requesting an increase of 29 000 and 63 000 men respectively in the active duty strength of the navy and the air force 4 to fulfill these manpower needs i am ordering that our draft calls be doubled and tripled in the coming months i am asking the congress for authority to order to active duty certain ready reserve units and individual reservists and to extend tours of duty 2 and under that authority i am planning to order to active duty a number of air transport squadrons and air national guard tactical air squadrons to give us the airlift capacity and protection that we need other reserve forces will be called up when needed 5 many ships and planes once headed for retirement are to be retained or reactivated increasing our airpower tactically and our sealift airlift and anti submarine warfare capability in addition our strategic air power will be increased by delaying the deactivation of b 47 bombers 6 finally some 1 8 billion about half of the total sum is needed for the procurement of non nuclear weapons ammunition and equipment the details on all these requests will be presented to the congress tomorrow subsequent steps will be taken to suit subsequent needs comparable efforts for the common defense are being discussed with our nato allies for their commitment and interest are as precise as our own and let me add that i am well aware of the fact that many american families will bear the burden of these requests studies or careers will be interrupted husbands and sons will be called away incomes in some cases will be reduced but these are burdens which must be borne if freedom is to be defended americans have willingly borne them before and they will not flinch from the task now we have another sober responsibility to recognize the possibilities of nuclear war in the missile age without our citizens knowing what they should do and where they should go if bombs begin to fall would be a failure of responsibility in may i pledged a new start on civil defense last week i assigned on the recommendation of the civil defense director basic responsibility for this program to the secretary of defense to make certain it is administered and coordinated with our continental defense efforts at the highest civilian level tomorrow i am requesting of the congress new funds for the following immediate objectives to identify and mark space in existing structures public and private that could be used for fall out shelters in case of attack to stock those shelters with food water first aid kits and other minimum essentials for survival to increase their capacity to improve our air raid warning and fall out detection systems including a new household warning system which is now under development and to take other measures that will be effective at an early date to save millions of lives if needed in the event of an attack the lives of those families which are not hit in a nuclear blast and fire can still be saved if they can be warned to take shelter and if that shelter is available we owe that kind of insurance to our families and to our country in contrast to our friends in europe the need for this kind of protection is new to our shores but the time to start is now in the coming months i hope to let every citizen know what steps he can take without delay to protect his family in case of attack i know that you will want to do no less the addition of 207 million in civil defense appropriations brings our total new defense budget requests to 3 454 billion and a total of 47 5 billion for the year this is an increase in the defense budget of 6 billion since january and has resulted in official estimates of a budget deficit of over 5 billion the secretary of the treasury and other economic advisers assure me however that our economy has the capacity to bear this new request we are recovering strongly from this year s recession the increase in this last quarter of our year of our total national output was greater than that for any postwar period of initial recovery and yet wholesale prices are actually lower than they were during the recession and consumer prices are only 1 4 of 1 higher than they were last october in fact this last quarter was the first in eight years in which our production has increased without an increase in the overall price index and for the first time since the fall of 1959 our gold position has improved and the dollar is more respected abroad these gains it should be stressed are being accomplished with budget deficits far smaller than those of the 1958 recession this improved business outlook means improved revenues and i intend to submit to the congress in january a budget for the next fiscal year which will be strictly in balance nevertheless should an increase in taxes be needed because of events in the next few months to achieve that balance or because of subsequent defense rises those increased taxes will be requested in january meanwhile to help make certain that the current deficit is held to a safe level we must keep down all expenditures not thoroughly justified in budget requests the luxury of our current post office deficit must be ended costs in military procurement will be closely scrutinized and in this effort i welcome the cooperation of the congress the tax loopholes i have specified on expense accounts overseas income dividends interest coo operatives and others must be closed i realize that no public revenue measure is welcomed by everyone but i am certain that every american wants to pay his fair share and not leave the burden of defending freedom entirely to those who bear arms for we have mortgaged our very future on this defense and we cannot fail to meet our responsibilities but i must emphasize again that the choice is not merely between resistance and retreat between atomic holocaust and surrender our peace time military posture is traditionally defensive but our diplomatic posture need not be our response to the berlin crisis will not be merely military or negative it will be more than merely standing firm for we do not intend to leave it to others to choose and monopolize the forum and the framework of discussion we do not intend to abandon our duty to mankind to seek a peaceful solution as signers of the un charter we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk and listen with reason if they have proposals not demands we shall hear them if they seek genuine understanding not concessions of our rights we shall meet with them we have previously indicated our readiness to remove any actual irritants in west berlin but the freedom of that city is not negotiable we cannot negotiate with those who say what s mine is mine and what s yours is negotiable but we are willing to consider any arrangement or treaty in germany consistent with the maintenance of peace and freedom and with the legitimate security interests of all nations we recognize the soviet union s historical concern about their security in central and eastern europe after a series of ravaging invasions and we believe arrangements can be worked out which will help to meet those concerns and make it possible for both security and freedom to exist in this troubled area for it is not the freedom of west berlin which is abnormal in germany today but the situation in that entire divided country if anyone doubts the legality of our rights in berlin we are ready to have it submitted to international adjudication if anyone doubts the extent to which our presence is desired by the people of west berlin compared to east german feelings about their regime we are ready to have that question submitted to a free vote in berlin and if possible among all the german people and let us hear at that time from the two and one half million refugees who have fled the communist regime in east germany voting for western type freedom with their feet the world is not deceived by the communist attempt to label berlin as a hot bed of war there is peace in berlin today the source of world trouble and tension is moscow not berlin and if war begins it will have begun in moscow and not berlin for the choice of peace or war is largely theirs not ours it is the soviets who have stirred up this crisis it is they who are trying to force a change it is they who have opposed free elections it is they who have rejected an all german peace treaty and the rulings of international law and as americans know from our history on our own old frontier gun battles are caused by outlaws and not by officers of the peace in short while we are ready to defend our interests we shall also be ready to search for peace in quiet exploratory talks in formal or informal meetings we do not want military considerations to dominate the thinking of either east or west and mr khrushchev may find that his invitation to other nations to join in a meaningless treaty may lead to their inviting him to join in the community of peaceful men in abandoning the use of force and in respecting the sanctity of agreements while all of these efforts go on we must not be diverted from our total responsibilities from other dangers from other tasks if new threats in berlin or elsewhere should cause us to weaken our program of assistance to the developing nations who are also under heavy pressure from the same source or to halt our efforts for realistic disarmament or to disrupt or slow down our economy or to neglect the education of our children then those threats will surely be the most successful and least costly maneuver in communist history for we can afford all these efforts and more but we cannot afford not to meet this challenge and the challenge is not to us alone it is a challenge to every nation which asserts its sovereignty under a system of liberty it is a challenge to all those who want a world of free choice it is a special challenge to the atlantic community the heartland of human freedom we in the west must move together in building military strength we must consult one another more closely than ever before we must together design our proposals for peace and labor together as they are pressed at the conference table and together we must share the burdens and the risks of this effort the atlantic community as we know it has been built in response to challenge the challenge of european chaos in 1947 of the berlin blockade in 1948 the challenge of communist aggression in korea in 1950 now standing strong and prosperous after an unprecedented decade of progress the atlantic community will not forget either its history or the principles which gave it meaning the solemn vow each of us gave to west berlin in time of peace will not be broken in time of danger if we do not meet our commitments to berlin where will we later stand if we are not true to our word there all that we have achieved in collective security which relies on these words will mean nothing and if there is one path above all others to war it is the path of weakness and disunity today the endangered frontier of freedom runs through divided berlin we want it to remain a frontier of peace this is the hope of every citizen of the atlantic community every citizen of eastern europe and i am confident every citizen of the soviet union for i cannot believe that the russian people who bravely suffered enormous losses in the second world war would now wish to see the peace upset once more in germany the soviet government alone can convert berlin s frontier of peace into a pretext for war the steps i have indicated tonight are aimed at avoiding that war to sum it all up we seek peace but we shall not surrender that is the central meaning of this crisis and the meaning of your government s policy with your help and the help of other free men this crisis can be surmounted freedom can prevail and peace can endure i would like to close with a personal word when i ran for the presidency of the united states i knew that this country faced serious challenges but i could not realize nor could any man realize who does not bear the burdens of this office how heavy and constant would be those burdens three times in my life time our country and europe have been involved in major wars in each case serious misjudgments were made on both sides of the intentions of others which brought about great devastation now in the thermonuclear age any misjudgment on either side about the intentions of the other could rain more devastation in several hours than has been wrought in all the wars of human history therefore i as president and commander in chief and all of us as americans are moving through serious days i shall bear this responsibility under our constitution for the next three and one half years but i am sure that we all regardless of our occupations will do our very best for our country and for our cause for all of us want to see our children grow up in a country at peace and in a world where freedom endures i know that sometimes we get impatient we wish for some immediate action that would end our perils but i must tell you that there is no quick and easy solution the communists control over a billion people and they recognize that if we should falter their success would be imminent we must look to long days ahead which if we are courageous and persevering can bring us what we all desire in these days and weeks i ask for your help and your advice i ask for your suggestions when you think we could do better all of us i know love our country and we shall all do our best to serve it in meeting my responsibilities in these coming months as president i need your good will and your support and above all your prayers thank you and good night

after the adjournment of the historical special session of the congress five weeks ago i purposely refrained from addressing you for two very good reasons first i think that we all wanted the opportunity of a little quiet thought to examine and assimilate in a mental picture the crowding events of the hundred days which had been devoted to the starting of the wheels of the new deal secondly i wanted a few weeks in which to set up the new administrative organization and to see the first fruits of our careful planning i think it will interest you if i set forth the fundamentals of this planning for national recovery and this i am very certain will make it abundantly clear to you that all of the proposals and all of the legislation since the fourth day of march have not been just a collection of haphazard schemes but rather the orderly component parts of a connected and logical whole long before inauguration day i became convinced that individual effort and local effort and even disjointed federal effort had failed and of necessity would fail and therefore that a rounded leadership by the federal government had become a necessity both of theory and of fact such leadership however had its beginning in preserving and strengthening the credit of the united states government because without that no leadership was a possibility for years the government had not lived within its income the immediate task was to bring our regular expenses within our revenues that has been done it may seem inconsistent for a government to cut down its regular expenses and at the same time to borrow and to spend billions for an emergency but it is not inconsistent because a large portion of the emergency money has been paid out in the form of sound loans which will be repaid to the treasury over a period of years and to cover the rest of the emergency money we have imposed taxes to pay the interest and the installments on that part of the debt so you will see that we have kept our credit good we have built a granite foundation in a period of confusion that foundation of the federal credit stands there broad and sure it is the base of the whole recovery plan then came the part of the problem that concerned the credit of the individual citizens themselves you and i know of the banking crisis and of the great danger to the savings of our people on march sixth every national bank was closed one month later 90 per cent of the deposits in the national banks had been made available to the depositors today only about 5 per cent of the deposits in national banks are still tied up the condition relating to state banks while not quite so good on a percentage basis is shoving a steady reduction in the total of frozen deposits a result much better than we had expected three months ago the problem of the credit of the individual was made more difficult because of another fact the dollar was a different dollar from the one with which the average debt had been incurred for this reason large numbers of people were actually losing possession of and title to their farms and homes all of you know the financial steps which have been taken to correct this inequality in addition the home loan act the farm loan act and the bankruptcy act were passed it was a vital necessity to restore purchasing power by reducing the debt and interest charges upon our people but while we were helping people to save their credit it was at the same time absolutely essential to do something about the physical needs of hundreds of thousands who were in dire straits at that very moment municipal and state aid were being stretched to the limit we appropriated half a billion dollars to supplement their efforts and in addition as you know we have put 300 000 young men into practical and useful work in our forests and to prevent flood and soil erosion the wages they earn are going in greater part to the support of the nearly one million people who constitute their families in this same classification we can properly place the great public works program running to a total of over three billion dollars to be used for highways and ships and flood prevention and inland navigation and thousands of self sustaining state and municipal improvements two points should be made clear in the allotting and administration of these projects first we are using the utmost care to choose labor creating quick acting useful projects avoiding the smell of the pork barrel and secondly we are hoping that at least half of the money will come back to the government from projects which will pay for themselves over a period of years thus far i have spoken primarily of the foundation stones the measures that were necessary to re establish credit and to head people in the opposite direction by preventing distress and providing as much work as possible through governmental agencies now i come to the links which will build us a more lasting prosperity i have said that we cannot attain that in a nation half boom and half broke if all of our people have work and fair wages and fair profits they can buy the products of their neighbors and business is good but if you take away the wages and the profits of half of them business is only half as good it doesn t help much if the fortunate half is very prosperous the best way is for everybody to be reasonably prosperous for many years the two great barriers to a normal prosperity have been low farm prices and the creeping paralysis of unemployment these factors have cut the purchasing power of the country in half i promised action congress did its part when it passed the farm and the industrial recovery acts today we are putting these two acts to work and they will work if people understand their plain objectives first the farm act it is based on the fact that the purchasing power of nearly half our population depends on adequate prices for farm products we have been producing more of some crops than we consume or can sell in a depressed world market the cure is not to produce so much without our help the farmers cannot get together and cut production and the farm bill gives them a method of bringing their production down to a reasonable level and of obtaining reasonable prices for their crops i have clearly stated that this method is in a sense experimental but so far as we have gone we have reason to believe that it will produce good results it is obvious that if we can greatly increase the purchasing power of the tens of millions of our people who make a living from farming and the distribution of farm crops we will greatly increase the consumption of those goods which are turned out by industry that brings me to the final step bringing back industry along sound lines last autumn on several occasions i expressed my faith that we can make possible by democratic self discipline in industry general increases in wages and shortening of hours sufficient to enable industry to pay its own workers enough to let those workers buy and use the things that their labor produces this can be done only if we permit and encourage cooperative action in industry because it is obvious that without united action a few selfish men in each competitive group will pay starvation wages and insist on long hours of work others in that group must either follow suit or close up shop we have seen the result of action of that kind in the continuing descent into the economic hell of the past four years there is a clear way to reverse that process if all employers in each competitive group agree to pay their workers the same wages reasonable wages and require the same hours reasonable hours then higher wages and shorter hours will hurt no employer moreover such action is better for the employer than unemployment and low wages because it makes more buyers for his product that is the simple idea which is the very heart of the industrial recovery act on the basis of this simple principle of everybody doing things together we are starting out on this nationwide attack on unemployment it will succeed if our people understand it in the big industries in the little shops in the great cities and in the small villages there is nothing complicated about it and there is nothing particularly new in the principle it goes back to the basic idea of society and of the nation itself that people acting in a group can accomplish things which no individual acting alone could even hope to bring about here is an example in the cotton textile code and in other agreements already signed child labor has been abolished that makes me personally happier than any other one thing with which i have been connected since i came to washington in the textile industry an industry which came to me spontaneously and with a splendid cooperation as soon as the recovery act was signed child labor was an old evil but no employer acting alone was able to wipe it out if one employer tried it or if one state tried it the costs of operation rose so high that it was impossible to compete with the employers or states which had failed to act the moment the recovery act was passed this monstrous thing which neither opinion nor law could reach through years of effort went out in a flash as a british editorial put it we did more under a code in one day than they in england had been able to do under the common law in eighty five years of effort i use this incident my friends not to boast of what has already been done but to point the way to you for even greater cooperative efforts this summer and autumn we are not going through another winter like the last i doubt if ever any people so bravely and cheerfully endured a season half so bitter we cannot ask america to continue to face such needless hardships it is time for courageous action and the recovery bill gives us the means to conquer unemployment with exactly the same weapon that we have used to strike down child labor the proposition is simply this if all employers will act together to shorten hours and raise wages we can put people back to work no employer will suffer because the relative level of competitive cost will advance by the same amount for all but if any considerable group should lag or shirk this great opportunity will pass us by and we will go into another desperate winter this must not happen we have sent out to all employers an agreement which is the result of weeks of consultation this agreement checks against the voluntary codes of nearly all the large industries which have already been submitted this blanket agreement carries the unanimous approval of the three boards which i have appointed to advise in this boards representing the great leaders in labor in industry and in social service the agreement has already brought a flood of approval from every state and from so wide a cross section of the common calling of industry that i know it is fair for all it is a plan deliberate reasonable and just intended to put into effect at once the most important of the broad principles which are being established industry by industry through codes naturally it takes a good deal of organizing and a great many hearings and many months to get these codes perfected and signed and we cannot wait for all of them to go through the blanket agreements however which i am sending to every employer will start the wheels turning now and not six months from now there are of course men a few of them who might thwart this great common purpose by seeking selfish advantage there are adequate penalties in the law but i am now asking the cooperation that comes from opinion and from conscience these are the only instruments we shall use in this great summer offensive against unemployment but we shall use them to the limit to protect the willing from the laggard and to make the plan succeed in war in the gloom of night attack soldiers wear a bright badge on their shoulders to be sure that comrades do not fire on comrades on that principle those who cooperate in this program must know each other at a glance that is why we have provided a badge of honor for this purpose a simple design with a legend we do our part and i ask that all those who join with me shall display that badge prominently it is essential to our purpose already all the great basic industries have come forward willingly with proposed codes and in these codes they accept the principles leading to mass reemployment but important as is this heartening demonstration the richest field for results is among the small employers those whose contribution will give new work for from one to ten people these smaller employers are indeed a vital part of the backbone of the country and the success of our plans lies largely in their hands already the telegrams and letters are pouring into the white house messages from employers who ask that their names be placed on this special roll of honor they represent great corporations and companies and partnerships and individuals i ask that even before the dates set in the agreements which we have sent out the employers of the country who have not already done so the big fellows and the little fellows shall at once write or telegraph to me personally at the white house expressing their intention of going through with the plan and it is my purpose to keep posted in the post office of every town a roll of honor of all those who join with me i want to take this occasion to say to the twenty four governors who are now in conference in san francisco that nothing thus far has helped in strengthening this great movement more than their resolutions adopted at the very outset of their meeting giving this plan their instant and unanimous approval and pledging to support it in their states to the men and women whose lives have been darkened by the fact or the fear of unemployment i am justified in saying a word of encouragement because the codes and the agreements already approved or about to be passed upon prove that the plan does raise wages and that it does put people back to work you can look on every employer who adopts the plan as one who is doing his part and those employers deserve well of everyone who works for a living it will be clear to you as it is to me that while the shirking employer may undersell his competitor the saving he thus makes is made at the expense of his country s welfare while we are making this great common effort there should be no discord and dispute this is no time to cavil or to question the standard set by this universal agreement it is time for patience and understanding and cooperation the workers of this country have rights under this law which cannot be taken from them and nobody will be permitted to whittle them away but on the other hand no aggression is now necessary to attain those rights the whole country will be united to get them for you the principle that applies to the employers applies to the workers as well and i ask you workers to cooperate in the same spirit when andrew jackson old hickory died someone asked will he go to heaven and the answer was he will if he wants to if i am asked whether the american people will pull themselves out of this depression i answer they will if they want to the essence of the plan is a universal limitation of hours of work per week for any individual by common consent and a universal payment of wages above a minimum also by common consent i cannot guarantee the success of this nationwide plan but the people of this country can guarantee its success i have no faith in cure alls but i believe that we can greatly influence economic forces i have no sympathy with the professional economists who insist that things must run their course and that human agencies can have no influence on economic ills one reason is that i happen to know that professional economists have changed their definition of economic laws every five or ten years for a very long time but i do have faith and retain faith in the strength of common purpose and in the strength of unified action taken by the american people that is why i am describing to you the simple purposes and the solid foundations upon which our program of recovery is built that is why i am asking the employers of the nation to sign this common covenant with me to sign it in the name of patriotism and humanity that is why i am asking the workers to go along with us in a spirit of understanding and of helpfulness

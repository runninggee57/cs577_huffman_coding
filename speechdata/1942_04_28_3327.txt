my fellow americans it is nearly five months since we were attacked at pearl harbor for the two years prior to that attack this country had been gearing itself up to a high level of production of munitions and yet our war efforts had done little to dislocate the normal lives of most of us since then we have dispatched strong forces of our army and navy several hundred thousand of them to bases and battlefronts thousands of miles from home we have stepped up our war production on a scale that is testing our industrial power and our engineering genius and our economic structure to the utmost we have had no illusions about the fact that this would be is a tough job and a long one american warships are now in combat in the north and south atlantic in the arctic in the mediterranean in the indian ocean and in the north and south pacific american troops have taken stations in south america greenland iceland the british isles the near east the middle east and the far east the continent of australia and many islands of the pacific american war planes manned by americans are flying in actual combat over all the continents and all the oceans on the european front the most important development of the past year has been without question the crushing counter offensive on the part of the great armies of russia against the powerful german army these russian forces have destroyed and are destroying more armed power of our enemies troops planes tanks and guns than all the other united nations put together in the mediterranean area matters remain on the surface much as they were but the situation there is receiving very careful attention recently we have received news of a change in government in what we used to know as the republic of france a name dear to the hearts of all lovers of liberty a name and an institution which we hope will soon be restored to full dignity throughout the nazi occupation of france we have hoped for the maintenance of a french government which would strive to regain independence to reestablish the principles of liberty equality and fraternity and to restore the historic culture of france our policy has been consistent from the very beginning however we are now greatly concerned lest those who have recently come to power may seek to force the brave french people into submission to nazi despotism the united nations will take measures if necessary to prevent the use of french territory in any part of the world for military purposes by the axis powers the good people of france will readily understand that such action is essential for the united nations to prevent assistance to the armies or navies or air forces of germany or italy and or japan the overwhelming majority of the french people understand that the fight of the united nations is fundamentally their fight that our victory means the restoration of a free and independent france and the saving of france from the slavery which would be imposed upon her by her external enemies and by her internal traitors we know how the french people really feel we know that a deep seated determination to obstruct every step in the axis plan extends from occupied france through vichy france all the way to the people of their colonies in every ocean and on every continent our planes are helping in the defense of french colonies today and soon american flying fortresses will be fighting for the liberation of the darkened continent of europe itself in all the occupied countries there are men and women and even little children who have never stopped fighting never stopped resisting never stopped proving to the nazis that their so called new order can will never be enforced upon free peoples in the german and italian peoples themselves there is a growing conviction that the cause of nazi ism and fascism is hopeless that their political and military leaders have led them along the bitter road which leads not to world conquest but to final defeat they cannot fail to contrast the present frantic speeches of these leaders with their arrogant boastings of a year ago and two years ago and on the other side of the world in the far east we have passed through a phase of serious losses we have inevitably lost control of a large portion of the philippine islands but this whole nation pays tribute to the filipino and american officers and men who held out so long on bataan peninsula to those grim and gallant fighters who still hold corregidor where the flag flies and to the forces which that are still striking effectively at the enemy on mindanao and other islands the malayan peninsula and singapore are in the hands of the enemy the netherlands east indies are almost entirely occupied though resistance there continues many other islands are in the possession of the japanese but there is good reason to believe that their southward advance has been checked australia new zealand and much other territory will be bases for offensive action and we are determined that the territory which that has been lost will be regained the japanese are pressing their northward advance in against burma with considerable power driving toward india and china they have been opposed with great bravery by small british and chinese forces aided by american fliers the news in burma tonight is not good the japanese may cut the burma road but i want to say to the gallant people of china that no matter what advances the japanese may make ways will be found to deliver airplanes and munitions of war to the armies of generalissimo chiang kai shek we remember that the chinese people were the first to stand up and fight against the aggressors in this war and in the future an a still unconquerable china will play its proper role in maintaining peace and prosperity not only in eastern asia but in the whole world for every advance that the japanese have made since they started their frenzied career of conquest they have had to pay a very heavy toll in warships in transports in planes and in men they are feeling the effects of those losses it is even reported from japan that somebody has dropped bombs on tokyo and on other principal centers of japanese war industries if this be true it is the first time in history that japan has suffered such indignities although the treacherous attack on pearl harbor was the immediate cause of our entry into the war that event found the american people spiritually prepared for war on a world wide scale we went into this war fighting we know what we are fighting for we realize that the war has become what hitler originally proclaimed it to be a total war not all of us can have the privilege of fighting our enemies in distant parts of the world not all of us can have the privilege of working in a munitions factory or a shipyard or on the farms or in oil fields or mines producing the weapons or the raw materials which that are needed by our armed forces but there is one front and one battle where everyone in the united states every man woman and child is in action and will be privileged to remain in action throughout this war that front is right here at home in our daily lives and in our daily tasks here at home everyone will have the privilege of making whatever self denial is necessary not only to supply our fighting men but to keep the economic structure of our country fortified and secure during the war and after the war this will require of course the abandonment not only of luxuries but of many other creature comforts every loyal american is aware of his individual responsibility whenever i hear anyone saying the american people are complacent they need to be aroused i feel like asking him to come to washington and to read the mail that floods into the white house and into all departments of this government the one question that recurs through all these thousands of letters and messages is what more can i do to help my country in winning this war to build the factories and to buy the materials and to pay the labor and to provide the transportation and to equip and feed and house the soldiers sailors and marines and to do all the thousands of things necessary in a war all cost a lot of money more money than has ever been spent by any nation at any time in the long history of the world we are now spending solely for war purposes the sum of about one hundred million dollars every day in the week but before this year is over that almost unbelievable rate of expenditure will be doubled all of this money has to be spent and spent quickly if we are to produce within the time now available the enormous quantities of weapons of war which we need but the spending of these tremendous sums presents grave danger of disaster to our national economy when your government continues to spend these unprecedented sums for munitions month by month and year by year that money goes into the pocketbooks and bank accounts of the people of the united states at the same time raw materials and many manufactured goods are necessarily taken away from civilian use and machinery and factories are being converted to war production you do not have to be a professor of mathematics or economics to see that if people with plenty of cash start bidding against each other for scarce goods the price of those goods them goes up yesterday i submitted to the congress of the united states a seven point program a program of general principles which taken together could be called the national economic policy for attaining the great objective of keeping the cost of living down i repeat them now to you in substance first we must through heavier taxes keep personal and corporate profits at a low reasonable rate second we must fix ceilings on prices and rents third we must stabilize wages fourth we must stabilize farm prices fifth we must put more billions into war bonds sixth we must ration all essential commodities which are scarce seventh we must discourage installment buying and encourage paying off debts and mortgages i do not think it is necessary to repeat what i said yesterday to the congress in discussing these general principles the important thing to remember is that earn one of these points is dependent on the others if the whole program is to work some people are already taking the position that every one of the seven points is correct except the one point which steps on their own individual toes a few seem very willing to approve self denial on the part of their neighbors the only effective course of action is a simultaneous attack on all of the factors which increase the cost of living in one comprehensive all embracing program covering prices and profits and wages and taxes and debts the blunt fact is that every single person in the united states is going to be affected by this program some of you will be affected more directly by one or two of these restrictive measures but all of you will be affected indirectly by all of them are you a business man or do you own stock in a business corporation well your profits are going to be cut down to a reasonably low level by taxation your income will be subject to higher taxes indeed in these days when every available dollar should go to the war effort i do not think that any american citizen should have a net income in excess of 25 000 per year after payment of taxes are you a retailer or a wholesaler or a manufacturer or a farmer or a landlord ceilings are being placed on the prices at which you can sell your goods or rent your property do you work for wages you will have to forego higher wages for your particular job for the duration of the war all of us are used to spending money for things that we want things however which are not absolutely essential we will all have to forego that kind of spending because we must put every dime and every dollar we can possibly spare out of our earnings into war bonds and stamps because the demands of the war effort require the rationing of goods of which there is not enough to go around because the stopping of purchases of non essentials will release thousands of workers who are needed in the war effort as i told the congress yesterday sacrifice is not exactly the proper word with which to describe this program of self denial when at the end of this great struggle we shall have saved our free way of life we shall have made no sacrifice the price for civilization must be paid in hard work and sorrow and blood the price is not too high if you doubt it ask those millions who live today under the tyranny of hitlerism ask the workers of france and norway and the netherlands whipped to labor by the lash whether the stabilization of wages is too great a sacrifice ask the farmers of poland and denmark of czechoslovakia and france looted of their livestock starving while their own crops are stolen from their land ask them whether parity prices are too great a sacrifice ask the businessmen of europe whose enterprises have been stolen from their owners whether the limitation of profits and personal incomes is too great a sacrifice ask the women and children whom hitler is starving whether the rationing of tires and gasoline and sugar is too great a sacrifice we do not have to ask them they have already given us their agonized answers this great war effort must be carried through to its victorious conclusion by the indomitable will and determination of the people as one great whole it must not be impeded by the faint of heart it must not be impeded by those who put their own selfish interests above the interests of the nation it must not be impeded by those who pervert honest criticism into falsification of fact it must not be impeded by self styled experts either in economics or military problems who know neither true figures nor geography itself it must not be impeded by a few bogus patriots who use the sacred freedom of the press to echo the sentiments of the propagandists in tokyo and berlin and above all it shall not be imperiled by the handful of noisy traitors betrayers of america and betrayers of christianity itself would be dictators who in their hearts and souls have yielded to hitlerism and would have this republic do likewise i shall use all of the executive power that i have to carry out the policy laid down if it becomes necessary to ask for any additional legislation in order to attain our objective of preventing a spiral in the cost of living i shall do so i know the american farmer the american workman and the american businessman i know that they will gladly embrace this economy and equality of sacrifice satisfied that it is necessary for the most vital and compelling motive in all their lives winning through to victory never in the memory of man has there been a war in which the courage the endurance and the loyalt y ies of civilians played so vital a part many thousands of civilians all over the world have been and are being killed or maimed by enemy action indeed it was the fortitude of the common people of britain under fire which enabled that island to stand and prevented hitler from winning the war in 1940 the ruins of london and coventry and other cities are today the proudest monuments to british heroism our own american civilian population is now relatively safe from such disasters and to an ever increasing extent our soldiers sailors and marines are fighting with great bravery and great skill on far distant fronts to make sure that we shall remain safe i should like to tell you one or two stories about the men we have in our armed forces there is for instance example dr corydon m wassell he was a missionary well known for his good works in china he is a simple modest retiring man nearly sixty years old but he entered the service of his country and was commissioned a lieutenant commander in the navy dr wassell was assigned to duty in java caring for wounded officers and men of the cruisers houston and marblehead which had been in heavy action in the java seas when the japanese advanced across the island it was decided to evacuate as many as possible of the wounded to australia but about twelve of the men were so badly wounded that they couldn t not be moved dr wassell remained with them these men knowing that he would be captured by the enemy but he decided to make a last desperate attempt to get the men out of java he asked each of them if he wished to take the chance and every one agreed he first had to get the twelve men to the sea coast fifty miles away to do this he had to improvise stretchers for the hazardous journey the men were suffering severely but dr wassell kept them alive by his skill and inspired them by his own courage and as the official report said dr wassell was almost like a christ like shepherd devoted to his flock on the sea coast he embarked the men on a little dutch ship they were bombed and they were machine gunned by waves of japanese planes dr wassell took virtual command of the ship and by great skill avoided destruction hiding in small little bays and little inlets a few days later dr wassell and his little small flock of wounded men reached australia safely and today dr wassell now wears the navy cross another story concerns a ship a ship rather than an individual man you may remember the tragic sinking of the submarine the u s s squalus off the new england coast in the summer of 1939 some of the crew were lost but others were saved by the speed and the efficiency of the surface rescue crews the squalus itself was tediously raised from the bottom of the ocean sea she was repaired and put back into commission and eventually she sailed again under a new name the u s s sailfish today she is a potent and effective unit of our submarine fleet in the southwest pacific the sailfish has covered many thousands of miles in operations in the those western pacific waters she has sunk a japanese destroyer she has torpedoed a japanese cruiser she has made two torpedo hits two of them on a japanese aircraft carrier three of the enlisted men of our navy who went down with the squalus in 1939 and were rescued are today serving on the same ship the u s s sailfish in this war it seems to me that it is heartening to know that the squalus once given up as lost rose from the depths to fight for our country in time of peril one more story which that i heard only this morning this is a story of one of our army flying fortresses operating in the western pacific the pilot of this plane is a modest young man proud of his crew for one of the toughest fights a bomber has yet experienced the bomber departed from its base as part or a flight of five bombers to attack japanese transports which that were landing troops against us in the philippines when they had gone about halfway to their destination one of the motors of this bomber went out of commission the young pilot lost contact with the other bombers the crew however got the motor working got it going again and the plane proceeded on its mission alone by the time it arrived at its target the other four flying fortresses had already passed over had dropped their bombs and had stirred up the hornets nest of japanese zero planes eighteen of them these zero fighters attacked our one flying fortress despite this mass attack our plane proceeded on its mission and dropped all of its bombs on six japanese transports which were lined up along the docks as it turned back on its homeward journey a running fight between the bomber and the eighteen japanese pursuit planes continued for seventy five miles four pursuit ships planes of the japs attacked simultaneously at each side and four were shot down with the side guns during this fight the bomber s radio operator was killed the engineer s right hand was shot off and one gunner was crippled leaving only one man available to operate both side guns although wounded in one hand this the gunner alternately manned both side guns bringing down three more japanese zero planes while this was going on one engine on the american bomber was shot out one gas tank was hit the radio was shot off and the oxygen system was entirely destroyed out of eleven control cables all but four were shot away the rear landing wheel was blown off entirely and the two front wheels were both shot flat the fight continued until the remaining japanese pursuit ships exhausted their ammunition and turned back with two engines gone and the plane practically out of control the american bomber returned to its base after dark and made an emergency landing the mission had been accomplished the name of that pilot is captain hewitt t wheless of the united states army he comes from a place called menard texas with a population 2 375 he has been awarded the distinguished service cross and i hope that he is listening these stories i have told you are not exceptional they are typical examples of individual heroism and skill as we here at home contemplate our own duties our own responsibilities let us think and think hard of the example which is being set for us by our fighting men our soldiers and sailors are members of well disciplined units but they are still and forever individuals free individuals they are farmers and workers businessmen professional men artists clerks they are the united states of america that is why they fight we too are the united states of america that is why we must work and sacrifice it is for them it is for us it is for victory

my friends no one not in my situation can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting to this place and the kindness of these people i owe every thing here i have lived a quarter of a century and have passed from a young to an old man here my children have been born and one is buried i now leave not knowing when or whether ever i may return with a task before me greater than that which rested upon washington without the assistance of that divine being who ever attended him i cannot succeed with that assistance i cannot fail trusting in him who can go with me and remain with you and be every where for good let us confidently hope that all will yet be well to his care commending you as i hope in your prayers you will commend me i bid you an affectionate farewell

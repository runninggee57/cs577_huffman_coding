states the senate of the united states respectfully take leave sir to to you their deep regret for the loss their country sustains in the death of general george washington this event so distressing to all our fellow citizens must be peculiarly heavy to you who have long been associated with him in deeds of patriotism permit us sir to mingle our tears with yours on this occasion it is manly to weep to lose such a man at such a crisis is no common calamity to the world our country mourns her father the almighty disposer of human events has taken from us our greatest benefactor and ornament it becomes us to submit with reverence to him who maketh darkness his pavilion with patriotic pride we review the life of our washington and compare him with those of other countries who have been preeminent in fame ancient and modern names are diminished before him greatness and guilt have too often been allied but his fame is whiter than it is brilliant the destroyers of nations stood abashed at the majesty of his virtue it reproved the intemperance of their ambition and darkened the splendor of victory the scene is closed and we are no longer anxious lest misfortune should sully his glory he has traveled on to the end of his journey and carried with him an increasing weight of honor he has deposited it safely where misfortune can not tarnish it where malice can not blast it favored of heaven he departed without exhibiting the weakness of humanity magnanimous in death the darkness of the grave could not obscure his brightness such was the man whom we deplore thanks to god his glory is consummated washington yet lives on earth in his spotless example his spirit is in heaven let his countrymen consecrate the memory of the heroic general the patriotic statesman and the virtuous sage let them teach their children never to forget that the fruit of his labors and his example are their inheritance samuel livermore president of the senate pro tempore december 23 1799 to which the president replied as follows united states december 23 1799 gentlemen of the senate i receive with the most respectful and affectionate sentiments in this impressive address the obliging expressions of your regard for the loss our country has sustained in the death of her most esteemed beloved and admired citizen in the multitude of my thoughts and recollections on this melancholy event you will permit me only to say that i have seen him in the days of adversity in some of the scenes of his deepest distress and most trying perplexities i have also attended him in his highest elevation and most prosperous felicity with uniform admiration of his wisdom moderation and constancy among all our original associates in that memorable league of the continent in 1774 which first expressed the sovereign will of a free nation in america he was the only one remaining in the general government although with a constitution more enfeebled than his at an age when he thought it necessary to prepare for retirement i feel myself alone bereaved of my last brother yet i derive a strong consolation from the unanimous disposition which appears in all ages and classes to mingle their sorrows with mine on this common calamity to the world the life of our washington can not suffer by comparison with those of other countries who have been most celebrated and exalted by fame the attributes and decorations of royalty could have only served to eclipse the majesty of those virtues which made him from being a modest citizen a more resplendent luminary misfortune had he lived could hereafter have sullied his glory only with those superficial minds who believing that characters and actions are marked by success alone rarely deserve to enjoy it malice could never blast his honor and envy made him a singular exception to her universal rule for himself he had lived enough to life and to glory for his fellow citizens if their prayers could have been answered he would have been immortal for me his departure is at a most unfortunate moment trusting however in the wise and righteous dominion of providence over the passions of men and the results of their councils and actions as well as over their lives nothing remains for me but humble resignation his example is now complete and it will teach wisdom and virtue to magistrates citizens and men not only in the present age but in future generations as long as our history shall be read if a trajan found a pliny a marcus aurelius can never want biographers eulogists or historians john adams the house of representatives having resolved

prime minister rabin chairman arafat foreign minister peres mr abbas president carter president bush distinguished guests on behalf of the united states and russia cosponsors of the middle east peace process welcome to this great occasion of history and hope today we bear witness to an extraordinary act in one of history s defining dramas a drama that began in the time of our ancestors when the word went forth from a sliver of land between tide fiver jordan and the mediterranean sea that hallowed piece of earth that land of light and revelation is the home to the memories and dreams of jews muslims and christians throughout the world as we all know devotion to that land has also been the source of conflict and bloodshed for too long throughout this century bitterness between the palestinian and jewish people has robbed the entire region of its resources its potential and too many of its sons and daughters the land has been so drenched in warfare and hatred the conflicting claims of history etched so deeply in the souls of the combatants there that many believed the past would always have the upper hand then 14 years ago the past began to give way when at this place and upon this desk three men of great vision signed their names to the camp david accords today we honor the memories of menachem begin and anwar sadat and we salute the wise leadership of president jimmy carter then as now we heard from those who said that conflict would come again soon but the peace between egypt and israel has endured just so this bold new venture today this brave gamble that the future can be better than the past must endure two years ago in madrid another president took a major step on the road to peace by bringing israel and all her neighbors together to launch direct negotiations and today we also express our deep thanks for the skillful leadership of president george bush ever since harry truman first recognized israel every american president democrat and republican has worked for peace between israel and her neighbors now the efforts of all who have labored before us bring us to this moment a moment when we dare to pledge what for so long seemed difficult even to imagine that the security of the israeli people will be reconciled with the hopes of the palestinian people and there will be more security and more hope for all today the leadership of israel and the palestine liberation organization will sign a declaration of principles on interim palestinian self government it charts a course toward reconciliation between two peoples who have both known the bitterness of exile now both pledge to put old sorrows and antagonisms behind them and to work for a shared future shaped by the values of the torah the koran and the bible let us salute also today the government of norway for its remarkable role in nurturing this agreement but above all let us today pay tribute to the leaders who had the courage to lead their people toward peace away from the scars of battle the wounds and the losses of the past toward a brighter tomorrow the word today thanks prime minister rabin foreign minister peres and chairman arafat their tenacity and vision has given us the promise of a new beginning what these leaders have done now must be done by others their achievement must be a catalyst for progress in all aspects of the peace process and those of us who support them must be there to help in all aspects for the peace must render the people who make it more secure a peace of the brave is within our reach throughout the middle east there is a great yearning for the quiet miracle of a normal life we know a difficult road lies ahead every peace has its enemies those who still prefer the easy habits of hatred to the hard labors of reconciliation but prime minister rabin has reminded us that you do not have to make peace with your friends and the koran teaches that if the enemy inclines toward peace do thou also incline toward peace therefore let us resolve that this new mutual recognition will be a continuing process in which the parties transform the very way they see and understand each other let the skeptics of this peace recall what once existed among these people there was a time when the traffic of ideas and commerce and pilgrims flowed uninterrupted among the cities of the fertile crescent in spain and the middle east muslims and jews once worked together to write brilliant chapters in the history of literature and science all this can come to pass again mr prime minister mr chairman i pledge the active support of the united states of america to the difficult work that lies ahead the united states is committed to ensuring that the people who are affected by this agreement will be made more secure by it and to leading the world in marshaling the resources necessary to implement the difficult details that will make real the principles to which you commit yourselves today together let us imagine what can be accomplished if all the energy and ability the israelis and the palestinians have invested into your struggle can now be channeled into cultivating the land and freshening the waters into ending the boycotts and creating new industry into building a land as bountiful and peaceful as it is holy above all let us dedicate ourselves today to your region s next generation in this entire assembly no one is more important than the group of israeli and arab children who are seated here with us today mr prime minister mr chairman this day belongs to you and because of what you have done tomorrow belongs to them we must not leave them prey to the politics of extremism and despair to those who would derail this process because they cannot overcome the fears and hatreds of the past we must not betray their future for too long the young of the middle east have been caught in a web of hatred not of their own making for too long they have been taught from the chronicles of war now we can give them the chance to know the season of peace for them we must realize the prophecy of isaiah that the cry of violence shall no more be heard in your land nor wrack nor ruin within your borders the children of abraham the descendants of isaac and ishmael have embarked together on a bold journey together today with all our hearts and all our souls we bid them shalom salaam peace

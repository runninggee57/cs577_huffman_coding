mr chief justice mr vice president my friends you will understand and i believe agree with my wish that the form of this inauguration be simple and its words brief we americans of today together with our allies are passing through a period of supreme test it is a test of our courage of our resolve of our wisdom of our essential democracy if we meet that test successfully and honorably we shall perform a service of historic importance which men and women and children will honor throughout all time as i stand here today having taken the solemn oath of office in the presence of my fellow countrymen in the presence of our god i know that it is america s purpose that we shall not fail in the days and the years that are to come we shall work for ajust and honorable peace a durable peace as today we work and fight for total victory in war we can and we will achieve such a peace we shall strive for perfection we shall not achieve it immediately but we still shall strive we may make mistakes but they must never be mistakes which result from faintness of heart or abandonment of moral principle i remember that my old schoolmaster dr peabody said in days that seemed to us then to be secure and untroubled things in life will not always run smoothly sometimes we will be rising toward the heights then all will seem to reverse itself and start downward the great fact to remember is that the trend of civilization itself is forever upward that a line drawn through the middle of the peaks and the valleys of the centuries always has an upward trend our constitution of 1787 was not a perfect instrument it is not perfect yet but it provided a firm base upon which all manner of men of all races and colors and creeds could build our solid structure of democracy today in this year of war 1945 we have learned lessons at a fearful cost and we shall profit by them we have learned that we cannot live alone at peace that our own well being is dependent on the well being of other nations far away we have learned that we must live as men and not as ostriches nor as dogs in the manger we have learned to be citizens of the world members of the human community we have learned the simple truth as emerson said that the only way to have a friend is to be one we can gain no lasting peace if we approach it with suspicion and mistrust or with fear we can gain it only if we proceed with the understanding and the confidence and the courage which flow from conviction the almighty god has blessed our land in many ways he has given our people stout hearts and strong arms with which to strike mighty blows for freedom and truth he has given to our country a faith which has become the hope of all peoples in an anguished world so we pray to him now for the vision to see our way clearly to see the way that leads to a better life for ourselves and for all our fellow men and to the achievement of his will to peace on earth

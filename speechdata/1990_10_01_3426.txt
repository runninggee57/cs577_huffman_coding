mr president thank you very much mr secretary general distinguished delegates to the united nations it is really a great privilege to greet you today as we begin what marks a new and historic session of the general assembly my congratulations to the honorable guido de marco on your election sir as president of the general assembly and on a personal note i want to say that having witnessed the unprecedented unity and cooperation of the past 2 months that i have never been prouder to have once served within your ranks and never been prouder that the united states is the host country for the united nations forty five years ago while the fires of an epic war still raged across two oceans and two continents a small group of men and women began a search for hope amid the ruins and they gathered in san francisco stepping back from the haze and horror to try to shape a new structure that might support an ancient dream intensely idealistic and yet tempered by war they sought to build a new kind of bridge a bridge between nations a bridge that might help carry humankind from its darkest hour to its brightest day the founding of the united nations embodied our deepest hopes for a peaceful world and during the past year we ve come closer than ever before to realizing those hopes we ve seen a century sundered by barbed threats and barbed wire give way to a new era of peace and competition and freedom the revolution of 89 swept the world almost with a life of its own carried by a new breeze of freedom it transformed the political climate from central europe to central america and touched almost every corner of the globe that breeze has been sustained by a now almost universal recognition of a simple fundamental truth the human spirit cannot be locked up forever the truth is people everywhere are motivated in much the same ways and people everywhere want much the same things the chance to live a life of purpose the chance to choose a life in which they and their children can learn and grow healthy worship freely and prosper through the work of their hands and their hearts and their minds we re not talking about the power of nations but the power of individuals the power to choose the power to risk the power to succeed this is a new and different world not since 1945 have we seen the real possibility of using the united nations as it was designed as a center for international collective security the changes in the soviet union have been critical to the emergence of a stronger united nations the u s soviet relationship is finally beyond containment and confrontation and now we seek to fulfill the promise of mutually shared understanding the long twilight struggle that for 45 years has divided europe our two nations and much of the world has come to an end much has changed over the last 2 years the soviet union has taken many dramatic and important steps to participate fully in the community of nations and when the soviet union agreed with so many of us here in the united nations to condemn the aggression of iraq there could be no doubt no doubt then that we had indeed put four decades of history behind us we are hopeful that the machinery of the united nations will no longer be frozen by the divisions that plagued us during the cold war that at last long last we can build new bridges and tear down old walls that at long last we will be able to build a new world based on an event for which we have all hoped an end to the cold war two days from now the world will be watching when the cold war is formally buried in berlin and in this time of testing a fundamental question must be asked a question not for any one nation but for the united nations and the question is this can we work together in a new partnership of nations can the collective strength of the world community expressed by the united nations unite to deter and defeat aggression because the cold war s battle of ideas is not the last epic battle of this century two months ago in the waning weeks of one of history s most hopeful summers the vast still beauty of the peaceful kuwaiti desert was fouled by the stench of diesel and the roar of steel tanks once again the sound of distant thunder echoed across a cloudless sky and once again the world awoke to face the guns of august but this time the world was ready the united nations security council s resolute response to iraq s unprovoked aggression has been without precedent since the invasion on august 2d the council has passed eight major resolutions setting the terms for a solution to the crisis the iraqi regime has yet to face the facts but as i said last month the annexation of kuwait will not be permitted to stand and this is not simply the view of the united states it is the view of every kuwaiti the arab league the united nations iraq s leaders should listen it is iraq against the world let me take this opportunity to make the policy of my government clear the united states supports the use of sanctions to compel iraq s leaders to withdraw immediately and without condition from kuwait we also support the provision of medicine and food for humanitarian purposes so long as distribution can be properly monitored our quarrel is not with the people of iraq we do not wish for them to suffer the world s quarrel is with the dictator who ordered that invasion along with others we have dispatched military forces to the region to enforce sanctions to deter and if need be defend against further aggression and we seek no advantage for ourselves nor do we seek to maintain our military forces in saudi arabia for 1 day longer than is necessary u s forces were sent at the request of the saudi government and the american people and this president want every single american soldier brought home as soon as this mission is completed let me also emphasize that all of us here at the u n hope that military force will never be used we seek a peaceful outcome a diplomatic outcome and one more thing in the aftermath of iraq s unconditional departure from kuwait i truly believe there may be opportunities for iraq and kuwait to settle their differences permanently for the states of the gulf themselves to build new arrangements for stability and for all the states and the peoples of the region to settle the conflicts that divide the arabs from israel but the world s key task now first and always must be to demonstrate that aggression will not be tolerated or rewarded through the u n security council iraq has been fairly judged by a jury of its peers the very nations of the earth today the regime stands isolated and out of step with the times separated from the civilized world not by space but by centuries iraq s unprovoked aggression is a throwback to another era a dark relic from a dark time it has plundered kuwait it has terrorized innocent civilians it has held even diplomats hostage iraq and its leaders must be held liable for these crimes of abuse and destruction but this outrageous disregard for basic human rights does not come as a total surprise thousands of iraqis have been executed on political and religious grounds and even more through a genocidal poison gas war waged against iraq s own kurdish villagers as a world community we must act not only to deter the use of inhumane weapons like mustard and nerve gas but to eliminate the weapons entirely and that is why 1 year ago i came to the general assembly with new proposals to banish these terrible weapons from the face of the earth i promised that the united states would destroy over 98 percent of its stockpile in the first 8 years of a chemical weapons ban treaty and 100 percent all of them in 10 years if all nations with chemical capabilities chemical weapons signed the treaty we ve stood by those promises in june the united states and the soviet union signed a landmark agreement to halt production and to destroy the vast majority of our stockpiles today u s chemical weapons are being destroyed but time is running out this isn t merely a bilateral concern the gulf crisis proves how important it is to act together and to act now to conclude an absolute worldwide ban on these weapons we must also redouble our efforts to stem the spread of nuclear weapons biological weapons and the ballistic missiles that can rain destruction upon distant peoples the united nations can help bring about a new day a day when these kinds of terrible weapons and the terrible despots who would use them are both a thing of the past it is in our hands to leave these dark machines behind in the dark ages where they belong and to press forward to cap a historic movement towards a new world order and a long era of peace we have a vision of a new partnership of nations that transcends the cold war a partnership based on consultation cooperation and collective action especially through international and regional organizations a partnership united by principle and the rule of law and supported by an equitable sharing of both cost and commitment a partnership whose goals are to increase democracy increase prosperity increase the peace and reduce arms and as we look to the future the calendar offers up a convenient milestone a signpost by which to measure our progress as a community of nations the year 2000 marks a turning point beginning not only the turn of the decade not only the turn of the century but also the turn of the millennium and 10 years from now as the 55th session of the general assembly begins you will again find many of us in this hall hair a bit more gray perhaps maybe a little less spring in our walk but you will not find us with any less hope or idealism or any less confidence in the ultimate triumph of mankind i see a world of open borders open trade and most importantly open minds a world that celebrates the common heritage that belongs to all the world s people taking pride not just in hometown or homeland but in humanity itself i see a world touched by a spirit like that of the olympics based not on competition that s driven by fear but sought out of joy and exhilaration and a true quest for excellence and i see a world where democracy continues to win new friends and convert old foes and where the americas north central and south can provide a model for the future of all humankind the world s first completely democratic hemisphere and i see a world building on the emerging new model of european unity not just europe but the whole world whole and free this is precisely why the present aggression in the gulf is a menace not only to one region s security but to the entire world s vision of our future it threatens to turn the dream of a new international order into a grim nightmare of anarchy in which the law of the jungle supplants the law of nations and that s why the united nations reacted with such historic unity and resolve and that s why this challenge is a test that we cannot afford to fail i am confident we will prevail success too will have lasting consequences reinforcing civilized standards of international conduct setting a new precedent in international cooperation brightening the prospects for our vision of the future there are 10 more years until this century is out 10 more years to put the struggles of the 20th century permanently behind us 10 more years to help launch a new partnership of nations and throughout those 10 years and beginning now the united nations has a new and vital role in building towards that partnership last year s general assembly showed how we can make greater progress toward a more pragmatic and successful united nations and for the first time the u n security council is beginning to work as it was designed to work and now is the time to set aside old and counterproductive debates and procedures and controversies and resolutions it s time to replace polemic attacks with pragmatic action and we ve shown that the u n can count on the collective strength of the international community we ve shown that the u n can rise to the challenge of aggression just as its founders hoped that it would and now is the time of testing and we must also show that the united nations is the place to build international support and consensus for meeting the other challenges we face the world remains a dangerous place and our security and well being often depends in part on events occurring far away we need serious international cooperative efforts to make headway on the threats to the environment on terrorism on managing the debt burden on fighting the scourge of international drug trafficking and on refugees and peacekeeping efforts around the world but the world also remains a hopeful place calls for democracy and human rights are being reborn everywhere and these calls are an expression of support for the values enshrined in the united nations charter they encourage our hopes for a more stable more peaceful more prosperous world free elections are the foundation of democratic government and can produce dramatic successes as we have seen in namibia and nicaragua and the time has come to structure the u n role in such efforts more formally and so today i propose that the u n establish a special coordinator for electoral assistance to be assisted by a u n electoral commission comprised of distinguished experts from around the world as with free elections we also believe that universal u n membership for all states is central to the future of this organization and to this new partnership we ve discussed in support of this principle and in conjunction with u n efforts to reduce regional tensions the united states fully supports u n membership for the republic of korea we do so without prejudice to the ultimate objective of reunification of the korean peninsula and without opposition to simultaneous membership for the democratic people s republic of korea building on these and other initiatives we must join together in a new compact all of us to bring the united nations into the 21st century and i call today for a major long term effort to do so we should build on the success the admirable success of our distinguished secretary general my longtime friend and yours my longtime colleague i might also say javier perez de cuellar we should strive for greater effectiveness and efficiency of the united nations the united states is committed to playing its part helping to maintain global security promoting democracy and prosperity and my administration is fully committed to supporting the united nations and to paying what we are obliged to pay by our commitment to the charter international peace and security and international freedom and prosperity require no less the world must know and understand from this hour from this day from this hall we step forth with a new sense of purpose a new sense of possibilities we stand together prepared to swim upstream to march uphill to tackle the tough challenges as they come not only as the united nations but as the nations of the world united and so let it be said of the final decade of the 20th century this was a time when humankind came into its own when we emerged from the grit and the smoke of the industrial age to bring about a revolution of the spirit and the mind and began a journey into a new day a new age and a new partnership of nations the u n is now fulfilling its promise as the world s parliament of peace and i congratulate you i support you and i wish you godspeed in the challenges ahead thank you very very much

when four years ago we met to inaugurate president the republic single minded in anxiety stood in spirit here we dedicated ourselves to the fulfillment of a vision to speed the time when there would be for all the people that security and peace essential to the pursuit of happiness we of the republic pledged ourselves to drive from the temple of our ancient faith those who had profaned it to end by action tireless and unafraid the stagnation and despair of that day we did those first things first our covenant with ourselves did not stop there instinctively we recognized a deeper need the need to find through government the instrument of our united purpose to solve for the individual the ever rising problems of a complex civilization repeated attempts at their solution without the aid of government had left us baffled and bewildered for without that aid we had been unable to create those moral controls over the services of science which are necessary to make science a useful servant instead of a ruthless master of mankind to do this we knew that we must find practical controls over blind economic forces and blindly selfish men we of the republic sensed the truth that democratic government has innate capacity to protect its people against disasters once considered inevitable to solve problems once considered unsolvable we would not admit that we could not find a way to master economic epidemics just as after centuries of fatalistic suffering we had found a way to master epidemics of disease we refused to leave the problems of our common welfare to be solved by the winds of chance and the hurricanes of disaster in this we americans were discovering no wholly new truth we were writing a new chapter in our book of self government this year marks the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the constitutional convention which made us a nation at that convention our forefathers found the way out of the chaos which followed the revolutionary war they created a strong government with powers of united action sufficient then and now to solve problems utterly beyond individual or local solution a century and a half ago they established the federal government in order to promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to the american people today we invoke those same powers of government to achieve the same objectives four years of new experience have not belied our historic instinct they hold out the clear hope that government within communities government within the separate states and government of the united states can do the things the times require without yielding its democracy our tasks in the last four years did not force democracy to take a holiday nearly all of us recognize that as intricacies of human relationships increase so power to govern them also must increase power to stop evil power to do good the essential democracy of our nation and the safety of our people depend not upon the absence of power but upon lodging it with those whom the people can change or continue at stated intervals through an honest and free system of elections the constitution of 1787 did not make our democracy impotent in fact in these last four years we have made the exercise of all power more democratic for we have begun to bring private autocratic powers into their proper subordination to the public s government the legend that they were invincible above and beyond the processes of a democracy has been shattered they have been challenged and beaten our progress out of the depression is obvious but that is not all that you and i mean by the new order of things our pledge was not merely to do a patchwork job with second hand materials by using the new materials of social justice we have undertaken to erect on the old foundations a more enduring structure for the better use of future generations in that purpose we have been helped by achievements of mind and spirit old truths have been relearned untruths have been unlearned we have always known that heedless self interest was bad morals we know now that it is bad economics out of the collapse of a prosperity whose builders boasted their practicality has come the conviction that in the long run economic morality pays we are beginning to wipe out the line that divides the practical from the ideal and in so doing we are fashioning an instrument of unimagined power for the establishment of a morally better world this new understanding undermines the old admiration of worldly success as such we are beginning to abandon our tolerance of the abuse of power by those who betray for profit the elementary decencies of life in this process evil things formerly accepted will not be so easily condoned hard headedness will not so easily excuse hardheartedness we are moving toward an era of good feeling but we realize that there can be no era of good feeling save among men of good will for these reasons i am justified in believing that the greatest change we have witnessed has been the change in the moral climate of america among men of good will science and democracy together offer an ever richer life and ever larger satisfaction to the individual with this change in our moral climate and our rediscovered ability to improve our economic order we have set our feet upon the road of enduring progress shall we pause now and turn our back upon the road that lies ahead shall we call this the promised land or shall we continue on our way for each age is a dream that is dying or one that is coming to birth many voices are heard as we face a great decision comfort says tarry a while opportunism says this is a good spot timidity asks how difficult is the road ahead true we have come far from the days of stagnation and despair vitality has been preserved courage and confidence have been restored mental and moral horizons have been extended but our present gains were won under the pressure of more than ordinary circumstance advance became imperative under the goad of fear and suffering the times were on the side of progress to hold to progress today however is more difficult dulled conscience irresponsibility and ruthless self interest already reappear such symptoms of prosperity may become portents of disaster prosperity already tests the persistence of our progressive purpose let us ask again have we reached the goal of our vision of that fourth day of march 1933 have we found our happy valley i see a great nation upon a great continent blessed with a great wealth of natural resources its hundred and thirty million people are at peace among themselves they are making their country a good neighbor among the nations i see a united states which can demonstrate that under democratic methods of government national wealth can be translated into a spreading volume of human comforts hitherto unknown and the lowest standard of living can be raised far above the level of mere subsistence but here is the challenge to our democracy in this nation i see tens of millions of its citizens a substantial part of its whole population who at this very moment are denied the greater part of what the very lowest standards of today call the necessities of life i see millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hangs over them day by day i see millions whose daily lives in city and on farm continue under conditions labeled indecent by a so called polite society half a century ago i see millions denied education recreation and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children i see millions lacking the means to buy the products of farm and factory and by their poverty denying work and productiveness to many other millions i see one third of a nation ill housed ill clad ill nourished it is not in despair that i paint you that picture i paint it for you in hope because the nation seeing and understanding the injustice in it proposes to paint it out we are determined to make every american citizen the subject of his country s interest and concern and we will never regard any faithful law abiding group within our borders as superfluous the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little if i know aught of the spirit and purpose of our nation we will not listen to comfort opportunism and timidity we will carry on overwhelmingly we of the republic are men and women of good will men and women who have more than warm hearts of dedication men and women who have cool heads and willing hands of practical purpose as well they will insist that every agency of popular government use effective instruments to carry out their will government is competent when all who compose it work as trustees for the whole people it can make constant progress when it keeps abreast of all the facts it can obtain justified support and legitimate criticism when the people receive true information of all that government does if i know aught of the will of our people they will demand that these conditions of effective government shall be created and maintained they will demand a nation uncorrupted by cancers of injustice and therefore strong among the nations in its example of the will to peace today we reconsecrate our country to long cherished ideals in a suddenly changed civilization in every land there are always at work forces that drive men apart and forces that draw men together in our personal ambitions we are individualists but in our seeking for economic and political progress as a nation we all go up or else we all go down as one people to maintain a democracy of effort requires a vast amount of patience in dealing with differing methods a vast amount of humility but out of the confusion of many voices rises an understanding of dominant public need then political leadership can voice common ideals and aid in their realization in taking again the oath of office as president of the united states i assume the solemn obligation of leading the american people forward along the road over which they have chosen to advance while this duty rests upon me i shall do my utmost to speak their purpose and to do their will seeking divine guidance to help us each and every one to give light to them that sit in darkness and to guide our feet into the way of peace

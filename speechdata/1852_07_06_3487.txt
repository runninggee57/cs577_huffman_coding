honors to henry clay on the fourth day of july 1776 the people of a few feeble and oppressed colonies of great britain inhabiting a portion of the atlantic coast of north america publicly declared their national independence and made their appeal to the justice of their cause and to the god of battles for the maintainance of that declaration that people were few in numbers and without resources save only their own wise heads and stout hearts within the first year of that declared independence and while its maintainance was yet problematical while the bloody struggle between those resolute rebels and their haughty would be masters was still waging of undistinguished parents and in an obscure district of one of those colonies henry clay was born the infant nation and the infant child began the race of life together for three quarters of a century they have travelled hand in hand they have been companions ever the nation has passed its perils and is free prosperous and powerful the child has reached his manhood his middle age his old age and is dead in all that has concerned the nation the man ever sympathised and now the nation mourns for the man the day after his death one of the public journals opposed to him politically held the following pathetic and beautiful language which i adopt partly because such high and exclusive eulogy originating with a political friend might offend good taste but chiefly because i could not in any language of my own so well express my thoughts alas who can realize that henry clay is dead who can realize that never again that majestic form shall rise in the council chambers of his country to beat back the storms of anarchy which may threaten or pour the oil of peace upon the troubled billows as they rage and menace around who can realize that the workings of that mighty mind have ceased that the throbbings of that gallant heart are stilled that the mighty sweep of that graceful arm will be felt no more and the magic of that eloquent tongue which spake as spake no other tongue besides hushed hushed forever who can realize that freedom s champion the champion of a civilized world and of all tongues and kindreds and people has indeed fallen alas in those dark hours which as they come in the history of all nations must come in ours those hours of peril and dread which our land has experienced and which she may be called to experience again to whom now may her people look up for that council counsel and advice which only wisdom and experience and patriotism can give and which only the undoubting confidence of a nation will receive perchance in the whole circle of the great and gifted of our land there remains but one on whose shoulders the mighty mantle of the departed statesman may fall one while we now write is doubtless pouring his tears over the bier of his brother and his friend brother friend ever yet in political sentiment as far apart as party could make them ah it is at times like these that the petty distinctions of mere party disappear we see only the great the grand the noble features of the departed statesman and we do not even beg permission to bow at his feet and mingle our tears with those who have ever been his political adherents we do not beg this permission we claim it as a right though we feel it as a privilege henry clay belonged to his country to the world mere party cannot claim men like him his career has been national his fame has filled the earth his memory will endure to the last syllable of recorded time henry clay is dead he breathed his last on yesterday at twenty minutes after eleven in his chamber at washington to those who followed his lead in public affairs it more appropriately belongs to pronounce his eulogy and pay specific honors to the memory of the illustrious dead but all americans may show the grief which his death inspires for his character and fame are national property as on a question of liberty he knew no north no south no east no west but only the union which held them all in its sacred circle so now his countrymen will know no grief that is not as wide spread as the bounds of the confederacy the career of henry clay was a public career from his youth he has been devoted to the public service at a period too in the world s history justly regarded as a remarkable era in human affairs he witnessed in the beginning the throes of the french revolution he saw the rise and fall of napoleon he was called upon to legislate for america and direct her policy when all europe was the battle field of contending dynasties and when the struggle for supremacy imperilled the rights of all neutral nations his voice spoke war and peace in the contest with great britain when greece rose against the turks and struck for liberty his name was mingled with the battle cry of freedom when south america threw off the thraldom of spain his speeches were read at the head of her armies by bolivar his name has been and will continue to be hallowed in two hemispheres for it is one of the few the immortal names that were not born to die to the ardent patriot and profound statesman he added a quality possessed by few of the gifted on earth his eloquence has not been surpassed in the effective power to move the heart of man clay was without an equal and the heaven born endowment in the spirit of its origin has been most conspicuously exhibited against intestine feud on at least three important occasions he has quelled our civil commotions by a power and influence which belonged to no other statesman of his age and times and in our last internal discord when this union trembled to its center in old age he left the shades of private life and gave the death blow to fraternal strife with the vigor of his earlier years in a series of senatorial efforts which in themselves would bring immortality by challenging comparison with the efforts of any statesman in any age he exorcised the demon which possessed the body politic and gave peace to a distracted land alas the achievement cost him his life he sank day by day to the tomb his pale but noble brow bound with a triple wreath put there by a grateful country may his ashes rest in peace while his spirit goes to take its station among the great and good men who preceded him while it is customary and proper upon occasions like the present to give a brief sketch of the life of the deceased in the case of mr clay it is less necessary than most others for his biography has been written and re written and read and re read for the last twenty five years so that with the exception of a few of the latest incidents of his life all is as well known as it can be the short sketch which i give is therefore merely to maintain the connection of this discourse henry clay was born on the 12th of april 1777 in hanover county virginia of his father who died in the fourth or fifth year of henry s age little seems to be known except that he was a respectable man and a preacher of the baptist persuasion mr clay s education to the end of his life was comparatively limited i say to the end of his life because i have understood that from time to time he added something to his education during the greater part of his whole life mr clay s lack of a more perfect early education however it may be regretted generally teaches at least one profitable lesson it teaches that in this country one can scarcely be so poor but that if he will he can acquire sufficient education to get through the world respectably in his twenty third year mr clay was licenced to practice law and emigrated to lexington kentucky here he commenced and continued the practice till the year 1803 when he was first elected to the kentucky legislature by successive elections he was continued in the legislature till the latter part of 1806 when he was elected to fill a vacancy of a single session in the united states senate in 1807 he was again elected to the kentucky house of representatives and by that body chosen its speaker in 1808 he was re elected to the same body in 1809 he was again chosen to fill a vacancy of two years in the united states senate in 1811 he was elected to the united states house of representatives and on the first day of taking his seat in that body he was chosen its speaker in 1813 he was again elected speaker early in 1814 being the period of our last british war mr clay was sent as commissioner with others to negotiate a treaty of peace which treaty was concluded in the latter part of the same year on his return from europe he was again elected to the lower branch of congress and on taking his seat in december 1815 was called to his old post the speaker s chair a position in which he was retained by successive elections with one brief intermission till the inauguration of john q adams in march 1825 he was then appointed secretary of state and occupied that important station till the inauguration of gen jackson in march 1829 after this he returned to kentucky resumed the practice of the law and continued it till the autumn of 1831 when he was by the legislature of kentucky again placed in the united states senate by a re election he was continued in the senate till he resigned his seat and retired in march 1842 in december 1849 he again took his seat in the senate which he again resigned only a few months before his death by the foregoing it is perceived that the period from the beginning of mr clay s official life in 1803 to the end of it in 1852 is but one year short of half a century and that the sum of all the intervals in it will not amount to ten years but mere duration of time in office constitutes the smallest part of mr clay s history throughout that long period he has constantly been the most loved and most implicitly followed by friends and the most dreaded by opponents of all living american politicians in all the great questions which have agitated the country and particularly in those great and fearful crises the missouri question the nullification question and the late slavery question as connected with the newly acquired territory involving and endangering the stability of the union his has been the leading and most conspicuous part in 1824 he was first a candidate for the presidency and was defeated and although he was successively defeated for the same office in 1832 and in 1844 there has never been a moment since 1824 till after 1848 when a very large portion of the american people did not cling to him with an enthusiastic hope and purpose of still elevating him to the presidency with other men to be defeated was to be forgotten but to him defeat was but a trifling incident neither changing him or the world s estimate of him even those of both political parties who have been preferred to him for the highest office have run far briefer courses than he and left him still shining high in the heavens of the political world jackson van buren harrison polk and taylor all rose after and set long before him the spell the long enduring spell with which the souls of men were bound to him is a miracle who can compass it it is probably true he owed his pre eminence to no one quality but to a fortunate combination of several he was surpassingly eloquent but many eloquent men fail utterly and they are not as a class generally successful his judgment was excellent but many men of good judgment live and die unnoticed his will was indomitable but this quality often secures to its owner nothing better than a character for useless obstinacy these then were mr clay s leading qualities no one of them is very uncommon but all taken together are rarely combined in a single individual and this is probably the reason why such men as henry clay are so rare in the world mr clay s eloquence did not consist as many fine specimens of eloquence does do of types and figures of antithesis and elegant arrangement of words and sentences but rather of that deeply earnest and impassioned tone and manner which can proceed only from great sincerity and a thorough conviction in the speaker of the justice and importance of his cause this it is that truly touches the chords of human sympathy and those who heard mr clay never failed to be moved by it or ever afterwards forgot the impression all his efforts were made for practical effect he never spoke merely to be heard he never delivered a fourth of july oration or an eulogy on an occasion like this as a politician or statesman no one was so habitually careful to avoid all sectional ground whatever he did he did for the whole country in the construction of his measures he ever carefully surveyed every part of the field and duly weighed every conflicting interest feeling as he did and as the truth surely is that the world s best hope depended on the continued union of these states he was ever jealous of and watchful for whatever might have the slightest tendency to separate them mr clay s predominant sentiment from first to last was a deep devotion to the cause of human liberty a strong sympathy with the oppressed every where and an ardent wish for their elevation with him this was a primary and all controlling passion subsidiary to this was the conduct of his whole life he loved his country partly because it was his own country but mostly because it was a free country and he burned with a zeal for its advancement prosperity and glory because he saw in such the advancement prosperity and glory of human liberty human right and human nature he desired the prosperity of his countrymen partly because they were his countrymen but chiefly to show to the world that freemen could be prosperous that his views and measures were always the wisest needs not to be affirmed nor should it be on this occasion where so many thinking differently join in doing honor to his memory a free people in times of peace and quiet when pressed by no common danger naturally divide into parties at such times the man who is of neither party is not cannot be of any consequence mr clay therefore was of a party taking a prominent part as he did in all the great political questions of his country for the last half century the wisdom of his course on many is doubted and denied by a large portion of his countrymen and of such it is not now proper to speak particularly but there are many others about his course upon which there is little or no disagreement amongst intelligent and patriotic americans of these last are the war of 1812 the missouri question nullification and the now recent compromise measures in 1812 mr clay though not unknown was still a young man whether we should go to war with great britain being the question of the day a minority opposed the declaration of war by congress while the majority though apparently inclining to war had for years wavered and hesitated to act decisively meanwhile british aggressions multiplied and grew more daring and aggravated by mr clay more than any other man the struggle was brought to a decision in congress the question being now fully before congress came up in a variety of ways in rapid succession on most of which occasions mr clay spoke adding to all the logic of which the subject was susceptible that noble inspiration which came to him as it came to no other he aroused and nerved and inspired his friends and confounded and bore down all opposition several of his speeches on these occasions were reported and are still extant but the best of these all never was during its delivery the reporters forgot their vocations dropped their pens and sat enchanted from near the beginning to quite the close the speech now lives only in the memory of a few old men and the enthusiasm with which they cherish their recollection of it is absolutely astonishing the precise language of this speech we shall never know but we do know we cannot help knowing that with deep pathos it pleaded the cause of the injured sailor that it invoked the genius of the revolution that it apostrophised the names of otis of henry and of washington that it appealed to the interest the pride the honor and the glory of the nation that it shamed and taunted the timidity of friends that it scorned and scouted and withered the temerity of domestic foes that it bearded and defied the british lion and rising and swelling and maddening in its course it sounded the onset till the charge the shock the steady struggle and the glorious victory all passed in vivid review before the entranced hearers important and exciting as was the war question of 1812 it never so alarmed the sagacious statesmen of the country for the safety of the republic as afterwards did the missouri question this sprang from that unfortunate source of discord negro slavery when our federal constitution was adopted we owned no territory beyond the limits or ownership of the states except the territory north west of the river ohio and east of the mississippi what has since been formed into the states of maine kentucky and tennessee was i believe within the limits of or owned by massachusetts virginia and north carolina as to the north western territory provision had been made even before the adoption of the constitution that slavery should never go there on the admission of the states into the union carved from the territory we owned before the constitution no question or at most no considerable question arose about slavery those which were within the limits of or owned by the old states following respectively the condition of the parent state and those within the north west territory following the previously made provision but in 1803 we purchased louisiana of the french and it included with much more what has since been formed into the state of missouri with regard to it nothing had been done to forestall the question of slavery when therefore in 1819 missouri having formed a state constitution without excluding slavery and with slavery already actually existing within its limits knocked at the door of the union for admission almost the entire representation of the non slave holding states objected a fearful and angry struggle instantly followed this alarmed thinking men more than any previous question because unlike all the former it divided the country by geographical lines other questions had their opposing partizans in all localities of the country and in almost every family so that no division of the union could follow such without a separation of friends to quite as great an extent as that of opponents not so with the missouri question on this a geographical line could be traced which in the main would separate opponents only this was the danger mr jefferson then in retirement wrote i had for a long time ceased to read newspapers or to pay any attention to public affairs confident they were in good hands and content to be a passenger in our bark to the shore from which i am not distant but this momentous question like a fire bell in the night awakened and filled me with terror i considered it at once as the knell of the union it is hushed indeed for the moment but this is a reprieve only not a final sentence a geographical line co inciding with a marked principle moral and political once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men will never be obliterated and every irritation will mark it deeper and deeper i can say with conscious truth that there is not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than i would to relieve us from this heavy reproach in any practicable way the cession of that kind of property for so it is misnamed is a bagatelle which would not cost me a second thought if in that way a general emancipation and expatriation could be effected and gradually and with due sacrifices i think it might be but as it is we have the wolf by the ears and we can neither hold him nor safely let him go justice is in one scale and self preservation in the other mr clay was in congress and perceiving the danger at once engaged his whole energies to avert it it began as i have said in 1819 and it did not terminate till 1821 missouri would not yield the point and congress that is a majority in congress by repeated votes showed a determination to not admit the state unless it should yield after several failures and great labor on the part of mr clay to so present the question that a majority could consent to the admission it was by a vote rejected and as all seemed to think finally a sullen gloom hung over the nation all felt that the rejection of missouri was equivalent to a dissolution of the union because those states which already had what missouri was rejected for refusing to relinquish would go with missouri all deprecated and deplored this but none saw how to avert it for the judgment of members to be convinced of the necessity of yielding was not the whole difficulty each had a constituency to meet and to answer to mr clay though worn down and exhausted was appealed to by members to renew his efforts at compromise he did so and by some judicious modifications of his plan coupled with laborious efforts with individual members and his own over mastering eloquence upon the floor he finally secured the admission of the state brightly and captivating as it had previously shown it was now perceived that his great eloquence was a mere embellishment or at most but a helping hand to his inventive genius and his devotion to his country in the day of her extreme peril after the settlement of the missouri question although a portion of the american people have differed with mr clay and a majority even appear generally to have been opposed to him on questions of ordinary administration he seems constantly to have been regarded by all as the man for a crisis accordingly in the days of nullification and more recently in the re appearance of the slavery question connected with our territory newly acquired of mexico the task of devising a mode of adjustment seems to have been cast upon mr clay by common consent and his performance of the task in each case was little else than a literal fulfilment of the public expectation mr clay s efforts in behalf of the south americans and afterwards in behalf of the greeks in the times of their respective struggles for civil liberty are among the finest on record upon the noblest of all themes and bear ample corroboration of what i have said was his ruling passion a love of liberty and right unselfishly and for their own sakes having been led to allude to domestic slavery so frequently already i am unwilling to close without referring more particularly to mr clay s views and conduct in regard to it he ever was on principle and in feeling opposed to slavery the very earliest and one of the latest public efforts of his life separated by a period of more than fifty years were both made in favor of gradual emancipation of the slaves in kentucky he did not perceive that on a question of human right the negroes were to be excepted from the human race and yet mr clay was the owner of slaves cast into life where slavery was already widely spread and deeply seated he did not perceive as i think no wise man has perceived how it could be at once eradicated without producing a greater evil even to the cause of human liberty itself his feeling and his judgment therefore ever led him to oppose both extremes of opinion on the subject those who would shiver into fragments the union of these states tear to tatters its now venerated constitution and even burn the last copy of the bible rather than slavery should continue a single hour together with all their more halting sympathisers have received and are receiving their just execration and the name and opinions and influence of mr clay are fully and as i trust effectually and enduringly arrayed against them but i would also if i could array his name opinions and influence against the opposite extreme against a few but an increasing number of men who for the sake of perpetuating slavery are beginning to assail and to ridicule the white man s charter of freedom the declaration that all men are created free and equal so far as i have learned the first american of any note to do or attempt this was the late john c calhoun and if i mistake not it soon after found its way into some of the messages of the governors of south carolina we however look for and are not much shocked by political eccentricities and heresies in south carolina but only last year i saw with astonishment what purported to be a letter of a very distinguished and influential clergyman of virginia copied with apparent approbation into a st louis newspaper containing the following to me very extraordinary language i am fully aware that there is a text in some bibles that is not in mine professional abolitionists have made more use of it than of any passage in the bible it came however as i trace it from saint voltaire and was baptized by thomas jefferson and since almost universally regarded as canonical authority all men are born free and equal this is a genuine coin in the political currency of our generation i am sorry to say that i have never seen two men of whom it is true but i must admit i never saw the siamese twins and therefore will not dogmatically say that no man ever saw a proof of this sage aphorism this sounds strangely in republican america the like was not heard in the fresher days of the republic let us contrast with it the language of that truly national man whose life and death we now commemorate and lament i quote from a speech of mr clay delivered before the american colonization society in 1827 we are reproached with doing mischief by the agitation of this question the society goes into no household to disturb its domestic tranquility it addresses itself to no slaves to weaken their obligations of obedience it seeks to affect no man s property it neither has the power nor the will to affect the property of any one contrary to his consent the execution of its scheme would augment instead of diminishing the value of the property left behind the society composed of free men concerns itself only with the free collateral consequences we are not responsible for it is not this society which has produced the great moral revolution which the age exhibits what would they who thus reproach us have done if they would repress all tendencies towards liberty and ultimate emancipation they must do more than put down the benevolent efforts of this society they must go back to the era of our liberty and independence and muzzle the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return they must renew the slave trade with all its train of atrocities they must suppress the workings of british philanthropy seeking to meliorate the condition of the unfortunate west indian slave they must arrest the career of south american deliverance from thraldom they must blow out the moral lights around us and extinguish that greatest torch of all which america presents to a benighted world pointing the way to their rights their liberties and their happiness and when they have achieved all those purposes their work will be yet incomplete they must penetrate the human soul and eradicate the light of reason and the love of liberty then and not till then when universal darkness and despair prevail can you perpetuate slavery and repress all sympathy and all humane and benevolent efforts among free men in behalf of the unhappy portion of our race doomed to bondage the american colonization society was organized in 1816 mr clay though not its projector was one of its earliest members and he died as for the many preceding years he had been its president it was one of the most cherished objects of his direct care and consideration and the association of his name with it has probably been its very greatest collateral support he considered it no demerit in the society that it tended to relieve slave holders from the troublesome presence of the free negroes but this was far from being its whole merit in his estimation in the same speech from which i have quoted he says there is a moral fitness in the idea of returning to africa her children whose ancestors have been torn from her by the ruthless hand of fraud and violence transplanted in a foreign land they will carry back to their native soil the rich fruits of religion civilization law and liberty may it not be one of the great designs of the ruler of the universe whose ways are often inscrutable by short sighted mortals thus to transform an original crime into a signal blessing to that most unfortunate portion of the globe this suggestion of the possible ultimate redemption of the african race and african continent was made twenty five years ago every succeeding year has added strength to the hope of its realization may it indeed be realized pharaoh s country was cursed with plagues and his hosts were drowned in the red sea for striving to retain a captive people who had already served them more than four hundred years may like disasters never befall us if as the friends of colonization hope the present and coming generations of our countrymen shall by any means succeed in freeing our land from the dangerous presence of slavery and at the same time in restoring a captive people to their long lost father land with bright prospects for the future and this too so gradually that neither races nor individuals shall have suffered by the change it will indeed be a glorious consummation and if to such a consummation the efforts of mr clay shall have contributed it will be what he most ardently wished and none of his labors will have been more valuable to his country and his kind but henry clay is dead his long and eventful life is closed our country is prosperous and powerful but could it have been quite all it has been and is and is to be without henry clay such a man the times have demanded and such in the providence of god was given us but he is gone let us strive to deserve as far as mortals may the continued care of divine providence trusting that in future national emergencies he will not fail to provide us the instruments of safety and security honors to henry clay on the fourth day of july 1776 the people of a few feeble and oppressed colonies of great britain inhabiting a portion of the atlantic coast of

purpose of still elevating him to the presidency with other men to be defeated was to be forgotten but to him defeat was but a trifling incident neither changing him or the world s estimate of him even those of both political parties who have been preferred to him for the highest office have run far briefer courses than he and left him still shining high in the heavens of the political world jackson van buren harrison polk and taylor all rose after and set long before him the spell the long enduring spell with which the souls of men were bound to him is a miracle who can compass it it is probably true he owed his pre eminence to no one quality but to a fortunate combination of several he was surpassingly eloquent but many eloquent men fail utterly and they are not as a class generally successful his judgment was excellent but many men of good judgment live and die unnoticed his will was indomitable but this quality often secures to its owner nothing better than a character for useless obstinacy these then were mr clay s leading qualities no one of them is very uncommon but all taken together are rarely combined in a single individual and this is probably the reason why such men as henry clay are so rare in the world mr clay s eloquence did not consist as many fine specimens of eloquence does of types and figures of antithesis and elegant arrangement of words and sentences but rather of that deeply earnest and impassioned tone and manner which can proceed only from great sincerity and a thorough conviction in the speaker of the justice and importance of his cause this it is that truly touches the chords of human sympathy and those who heard mr clay never failed to be moved by it or ever afterwards forgot the impression all his efforts were made for practical effect he never spoke merely to be heard he never delivered a fourth of july oration or an eulogy on an occasion like this as a politician or statesman no one was so habitually careful to avoid all sectional ground whatever he did he did for the whole country in the construction of his measures he ever carefully surveyed every part of the field and duly weighed every conflicting interest feeling as he did and as the truth surely is that the world s best hope depended on the continued union of these states he was ever jealous of and watchful for whatever might have the slightest tendency to separate them mr clay s predominant sentiment from first to last was a deep devotion to the cause of human liberty a strong sympathy with the oppressed every where and an ardent wish for their elevation with him this was a primary and all controlling passion subsidiary to this was the conduct of his whole life he loved his country partly because it was his own country but mostly because it was a free country and he burned with a zeal for its advancement prosperity and glory because he saw in such the advancement prosperity and glory of human liberty human right and human nature he desired the prosperity of his countrymen partly because they were his countrymen but chiefly to show to the world that freemen could be prosperous that his views and measures were always the wisest needs not to be affirmed nor should it be on this occasion where so many thinking differently join in doing honor to his memory a free people in times of peace and quiet when pressed by no common danger naturally divide into parties at such times the man who is of neither party is not cannot be of any consequence mr clay therefore was of a party taking a prominent part as he did in all the great political questions of his country for the last half century the wisdom of his course on many is doubted and denied by a large portion of his countrymen and of such it is not now proper to speak particularly but there are many others about his course upon which there is little or no disagreement amongst intelligent and patriotic americans of these last are the war of 1812 the missouri question nullification and the now recent compromise measures in 1812 mr clay though not unknown was still a young man whether we should go to war with great britain being the question of the day a minority opposed the declaration of war by congress while the majority though apparently inclining to war had for years wavered and hesitated to act decisively meanwhile british aggressions multiplied and grew more daring and aggravated by mr clay more than any other man the struggle was brought to a decision in congress the question being now fully before congress came up in a variety of ways in rapid succession on most of which occasions mr clay spoke adding to all the logic of which the subject was susceptible that noble inspiration which came to him as it came to no other he aroused and nerved and inspired his friends and confounded and bore down all opposition several of his speeches on these occasions were reported and are still extant but the best of these all never was during its delivery the reporters forgot their vocations dropped their pens and sat enchanted from near the beginning to quite the close the speech now lives only in the memory of a few old men and the enthusiasm with which they cherish their recollection of it is absolutely astonishing the precise language of this speech we shall never know but we do know we cannot help knowing that with deep pathos it pleaded the cause of the injured sailor that it invoked the genius of the revolution that it apostrophised the names of otis of henry and of washington that it appealed to the interest the pride the honor and the glory of the nation that it shamed and taunted the timidity of friends that it scorned and scouted and withered the temerity of domestic foes that it bearded and defied the british lion and rising and swelling and maddening in its course it sounded the onset till the charge the shock the steady struggle and the glorious victory all passed in vivid review before the entranced hearers important and exciting as was the war question of 1812 it never so alarmed the sagacious statesmen of the country for the safety of the republic as afterwards did the missouri question this sprang from that unfortunate source of discord negro slavery when our federal constitution was adopted we owned no territory beyond the limits or ownership of the states except the territory north west of the river ohio and east of the mississippi what has since been formed into the states of maine kentucky and tennessee was i believe within the limits of or owned by massachusetts virginia and north carolina as to the north western territory provision had been made even before the adoption of the constitution that slavery should never go there on the admission of the states into the union carved from the territory we owned before the constitution no question or at most no considerable question arose about slavery those which were within the limits of or owned by the old states following respectively the condition of the parent state and those within the north west territory following the previously made provision but in 1803 we purchased louisiana of the french and it included with much more what has since been formed into the state of missouri with regard to it nothing had been done to forestall the question of slavery when therefore in 1819 missouri having formed a state constitution without excluding slavery and with slavery already actually existing within its limits knocked at the door of the union for admission almost the entire representation of the non slave holding states objected a fearful and angry struggle instantly followed this alarmed thinking men more than any previous question because unlike all the former it divided the country by geographical lines other questions had their opposing partizans in all localities of the country and in almost every family so that no division of the union could follow such without a separation of friends to quite as great an extent as that of opponents not so with the missouri question on this a geographical line could be traced which in the main would separate opponents only this was the danger mr jefferson then in retirement wrote i had for a long time ceased to read newspapers or to pay any attention to public affairs confident they were in good hands and content to be a passenger in our bark to the shore from which i am not distant but this momentous question like a fire bell in the night awakened and filled me with terror i considered it at once as the knell of the union it is hushed indeed for the moment but this is a reprieve only not a final sentence a geographical line co inciding with a marked principle moral and political once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men will never be obliterated and every irritation will mark it deeper and deeper i can say with conscious truth that there is not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than i would to relieve us from this heavy reproach in any practicable way the cession of that kind of property for so it is misnamed is a bagatelle which would not cost me a second thought if in that way a general emancipation and expatriation could be effected and gradually and with due sacrifices i think it might be but as it is we have the wolf by the ears and we can neither hold him nor safely let him go justice is in one scale and self preservation in the other mr clay was in congress and perceiving the danger at once engaged his whole energies to avert it it began as i have said in 1819 and it did not terminate till 1821 missouri would not yield the point and congress that is a majority in congress by repeated votes showed a determination to not admit the state unless it should yield after several failures and great labor on the part of mr clay to so present the question that a majority could consent to the admission it was by a vote rejected and as all seemed to think finally a sullen gloom hung over the nation all felt that the rejection of missouri was equivalent to a dissolution of the union because those states which already had what missouri was rejected for refusing to relinquish would go with missouri all deprecated and deplored this but none saw how to avert it for the judgment of members to be convinced of the necessity of yielding was not the whole difficulty each had a constituency to meet and to answer to mr clay though worn down and exhausted was appealed to by members to renew his efforts at compromise he did so and by some judicious modifications of his plan coupled with laborious efforts with individual members and his own over mastering eloquence upon the floor he finally secured the admission of the state brightly and captivating as it had previously shown it was now perceived that his great eloquence was a mere embellishment or at most but a helping hand to his inventive genius and his devotion to his country in the day of her extreme peril after the settlement of the missouri question although a portion of the american people have differed with mr clay and a majority even appear generally to have been opposed to him on questions of ordinary administration he seems constantly to have been regarded by all as the man for a crisis accordingly in the days of nullification and more recently in the re appearance of the slavery question connected with our territory newly acquired of mexico the task of devising a mode of adjustment seems to have been cast upon mr clay by common consent and his performance of the task in each case was little else than a literal fulfilment of the public expectation mr clay s efforts in behalf of the south americans and afterwards in behalf of the greeks in the times of their respective struggles for civil liberty are among the finest on record upon the noblest of all themes and bear ample corroboration of what i have said was his ruling passion a love of liberty and right unselfishly and for their own sakes having been led to allude to domestic slavery so frequently already i am unwilling to close without referring more particularly to mr clay s views and conduct in regard to it he ever was on principle and in feeling opposed to slavery the very earliest and one of the latest public efforts of his life separated by a period of more than fifty years were both made in favor of gradual emancipation of the slaves in kentucky he did not perceive that on a question of human right the negroes were to be excepted from the human race and yet mr clay was the owner of slaves cast into life where slavery was already widely spread and deeply seated he did not perceive as i think no wise man has perceived how it could be at once eradicated without producing a greater evil even to the cause of human liberty itself his feeling and his judgment therefore ever led him to oppose both extremes of opinion on the subject those who would shiver into fragments the union of these states tear to tatters its now venerated constitution and even burn the last copy of the bible rather than slavery should continue a single hour together with all their more halting sympathisers have received and are receiving their just execration and the name and opinions and influence of mr clay are fully and as i trust effectually and enduringly arrayed against them but i would also if i could array his name opinions and influence against the opposite extreme against a few but an increasing number of men who for the sake of perpetuating slavery are beginning to assail and to ridicule the white man s charter of freedom the declaration that all men are created free and equal so far as i have learned the first american of any note to do or attempt this was the late john c calhoun and if i mistake not it soon after found its way into some of the messages of the governors of south carolina we however look for and are not much shocked by political eccentricities and heresies in south carolina but only last year i saw with astonishment what purported to be a letter of a very distinguished and influential clergyman of virginia copied with apparent approbation into a st louis newspaper containing the following to me very extraordinary language i am fully aware that there is a text in some bibles that is not in mine professional abolitionists have made more use of it than of any passage in the bible it came however as i trace it from saint voltaire and was baptized by thomas jefferson and since almost universally regarded as canonical authority all men are born free and equal this is a genuine coin in the political currency of our generation i am sorry to say that i have never seen two men of whom it is true but i must admit i never saw the siamese twins and therefore will not dogmatically say that no man ever saw a proof of this sage aphorism this sounds strangely in republican america the like was not heard in the fresher days of the republic let us contrast with it the language of that truly national man whose life and death we now commemorate and lament i quote from a speech of mr clay delivered before the american colonization society in 1827 we are reproached with doing mischief by the agitation of this question the society goes into no household to disturb its domestic tranquility it addresses itself to no slaves to weaken their obligations of obedience it seeks to affect no man s property it neither has the power nor the will to affect the property of any one contrary to his consent the execution of its scheme would augment instead of diminishing the value of the property left behind the society composed of free men concerns itself only with the free collateral consequences we are not responsible for it is not this society which has produced the great moral revolution which the age exhibits what would they who thus reproach us have done if they would repress all tendencies towards liberty and ultimate emancipation they must do more than put down the benevolent efforts of this society they must go back to the era of our liberty and independence and muzzle the cannon which thunders its annual joyous return they must renew the slave trade with all its train of atrocities they must suppress the workings of british philanthropy seeking to meliorate the condition of the unfortunate west indian slave they must arrest the career of south american deliverance from thraldom they must blow out the moral lights around us and extinguish that greatest torch of all which america presents to a benighted world pointing the way to their rights their liberties and their happiness and when they have achieved all those purposes their work will be yet incomplete they must penetrate the human soul and eradicate the light of reason and the love of liberty then and not till then when universal darkness and despair prevail can you perpetuate slavery and repress all sympathy and all humane and benevolent efforts among free men in behalf of the unhappy portion of our race doomed to bondage the american colonization society was organized in 1816 mr clay though not its projector was one of its earliest members and he died as for the many preceding years he had been its president it was one of the most cherished objects of his direct care and consideration and the association of his name with it has probably been its very greatest collateral support he considered it no demerit in the society that it tended to relieve slave holders from the troublesome presence of the free negroes but this was far from being its whole merit in his estimation in the same speech from which i have quoted he says there is a moral fitness in the idea of returning to africa her children whose ancestors have been torn from her by the ruthless hand of fraud and violence transplanted in a foreign land they will carry back to their native soil the rich fruits of religion civilization law and liberty may it not be one of the great designs of the ruler of the universe whose ways are often inscrutable by short sighted mortals thus to transform an original crime into a signal blessing to that most unfortunate portion of the globe this suggestion of the possible ultimate redemption of the african race and african continent was made twenty five years ago every succeeding year has added strength to the hope of its realization may it indeed be realized pharaoh s country was cursed with plagues and his hosts were drowned in the red sea for striving to retain a captive people who had already served them more than four hundred years may like disasters never befall us if as the friends of colonization hope the present and coming generations of our countrymen shall by any means succeed in freeing our land from the dangerous presence of slavery and at the same time in restoring a captive people to their long lost father land with bright prospects for the future and this too so gradually that neither races nor individuals shall have suffered by the change it will indeed be a glorious consummation and if to such a consummation the efforts of mr clay shall have contributed it will be what he most ardently wished and none of his labors will have been more valuable to his country and his kind but henry clay is dead his long and eventful life is closed our country is prosperous and powerful but could it have been quite all it has been and is and is to be without henry clay such a man the times have demanded and such in the providence of god was given us but he is gone let us strive to deserve as far as mortals may the continued care of divine providence trusting that in future national emergencies he will not fail to provide us the instruments of safety and security

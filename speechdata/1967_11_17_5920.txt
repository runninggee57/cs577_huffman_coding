the president good morning ladies and gentlemen i will be glad to take your questions q do you think that at this point our force levels in vietnam will begin to level off in authorized strength or do you think more troops may be needed in the future the president we have previously considered and approved the recommendations of the joint chiefs of staff for the force level general westmoreland discussed this at some length with me last night and this morning he anticipates no increase in that level q mr president we are getting close to the end of your 4th year in office you have been subjected to a great deal of personal criticism ranging from a senator in your own party planning to run the president i am generally familiar with that q to the preacher in williamsburg i wonder how you appraise this personally the president it is not a surprise i am aware that this has happened to the 35 presidents who preceded me no public official certainly not one who has been in public life 35 years as i have been would fail to expect criticism there is a different type of criticism there is a difference between constructive dissent and storm trooper bullying howling and taking the law into your own hands i think that the president must expect that those in the other party will frequently find it necessary to find fault and to complain to attempt to picture to the people that the president should be replaced it is also true in all parties that there are divisions we don t all think alike if we did one man would be doing all the thinking so you have divisions in parties we have perhaps more than our share sometimes but i am sure the republicans think that too when you get into a political year with the help and advice and the abetting that the press can do and the assistance that the opposing party can do because it is to their interest to try to destroy you in order to have a place for themselves and you take the divisions in your own party and they concentrate then it does seem to mount up and at times occupy a great deal of public attention but i don t think it is unusual for a president to be criticized that seems to be one of the things that goes with the job not many of us want to say i failed or i made a mistake or we shouldn t have done that or this shouldn t have happened it is always easier to say that someone over there is wrong the president is more or less a lightning rod at least i have seen that in this country i remember to take one or two illustrations when president truman very courageously and i think very wisely went into korea one of our pollsters dashed out with a poll dr gallup and found that that position was approved by about 81 percent six months later when the sacrifices were evident and the problems began to appear the same pollster talking to the same people found that this had dropped from 81 to 26 percent now those things have happened in all of our crises economic domestic and international a president learns to expect them and learns to live with them the important thing for every man who occupies this place is to search as best he can to get the right answer to try to find out what is right and then do it without regard to polls and without regard to criticism q mr president a good many americans have said that a stop to the bombing is worth trying just to see if north vietnam will respond what is your view on this the president north vietnam has responded their statement this week in the hanoi newspaper in response to my statement from the enterprise is very clear and very compelling it should answer any person in this country who has ever felt that stopping the bombing alone would bring us to the negotiating table hanoi made it very clear in response to my appeal from the enterprise that their position in effect was the same as it has always been it was the same as enunciated in ho chi minh s letter to me which ho chi minh made public there are some hopeful people and there are some naive people in this country and there are some political people but anyone who really wants to know what the position of north vietnam is should read what the spokesmen of north vietnam say that is best summarized in mr ho chi minh s letter to the president that he made public that is on the record that he has never changed so all of these hopes dreams and idealistic people going around are misleading and confusing and weakening our position q do you have any evidence that the vietcong might be moving toward the position of wanting to negotiate separate from hanoi and if so what would be your attitude toward negotiating with them the president i would prefer to handle our negotiations through diplomatic channels with whomsoever we may negotiate i don t think this is the place to do our negotiating we are very anxious to find a solution that will bring an end to the war as we have stated so many times we are ready to meet and discuss that with the officials of hanoi and the vietcong will have no problem in having their voice fully heard and considered but i think that it would be better if we would wait until opportunity develops along that line and then do it through our trained diplomats q mr president a minute ago you talked about the job of being president this wednesday you are going to complete 4 years in the office of the president i wonder if you could reflect for a moment on the presidency and what have been your greatest satisfactions and what are your greatest disappointments the president well i think we had better do that a little later i can t tell all the good things that have happened or the bad ones either in these 4 years in a 30 minute press conference i would be charged with filibustering but we primarily want to think of the future and not the past it has been almost two centuries since our revolution and since we won our freedom we have come a long way during that period but we have much farther to go as you can see from our education and health and city statistics and farm statistics as long as there are four people out of every ten in the world who can t spell cat or can t write dog we have much to do i am particularly proud of what we have done in education from head start to adult education where men and women past 70 are learning to read and write for the first time i am very pleased for instance that we have raised our contributions from the federal government to higher education from 16 percent to 24 percent in the last 4 years while the states have remained practically static we have made revolutionary strides in education in health in conservation where we are probably taking in as much land in the public domain for the first time in years as we are letting out we feel that we have brought a degree of stability into our international relations to this hemisphere through the alliance for progress and our meetings at punta del este working with other nations we have made material advances in helping underdeveloped nations in africa we are very pleased with what has come out of our meetings with the germans and with the british in connection with our trilateral talks what has come out of our kennedy round meetings the several treaties that we have negotiated with the soviet union and the one that we are working on so hard now the nonproliferation treaty we are happy that 9 million more people have good paying jobs today than had them when i came into this office but these are things of the past and we should accept they are here we want to preserve them but the important problems are ahead what is the next century going to be like what is the third century going to be like as long as the ancient enemies are rampant in the world illiteracy ignorance disease poverty and war there is much for government to do we are working on that now we will be talking more to you about that in the months ahead q mr president in view of your talks this week with general westmoreland ambassador bunker and others what is your present assessment of our progress and prospects in vietnam the president well i will repeat to you their assessment because they are the ones who are in the best position to judge things locally i will give you my evaluation of what they have said first i think every american s heart should swell with pride at the competence and capacity of our leadership in vietnam i believe and our allied people believe that we have a superior leadership i think it is the best that the united states of america can produce in experience in judgment in training in general competence i have had three meetings with ambassador bunker and three with general westmoreland i had coffee with him at length this morning just before i came here our american people when we get in a contest of any kind whether it is in a war an election a football game or whatever it is want it decided and decided quickly get in or get out they like that curve to rise like this indicating a sharp rise and they like the opposition to go down like this indicating a sharply declining line that is not the kind of war we are fighting in vietnam we made our statement to the world of what we would do if we had communist aggression in that part of the world in 1954 we said we would stand with those people in the face of common danger the time came when we had to put up or shut up we put up and we are there we don t march out and have a big battle each day in a guerrilla war it is a new kind of war for us so it doesn t move that fast summarizing and trying to be fully responsive to your question in the time allotted we are moving more like this indicating gradual rise they are moving more like this indicating decline instead of straight up and straight down we are making progress we are pleased with the results that we are getting we are inflicting greater losses than we are taking amidst the horrors of war and more people have been killed trying to vote in south vietnam than have been killed by bombs in north vietnam according to the north vietnam figures in the midst of all the horrors of war in guerrilla fighting in south vietnam we have had five elections in a period of a little over 14 months there was great doubt whether we could have any it took us from 1776 to 1789 not 13 months but 13 years to get a constitution with our anglo saxon background and all the training we had to think that here in the midst of war when the grenades are popping like firecrackers all around you that two thirds or three fourths of the people would register and vote and have 5 elections in 13 months and through the democratic process select people at the local level a constituent assembly a house of representatives a senate a president and a vice president that is encouraging the fact that the population under free control has constantly risen and that under communist control has constantly gone down is a very encouraging sign the improvement that has been made by the south vietnamese themselves in putting in reforms in announcing other programs and in improving their own army is a matter of great satisfaction to ambassador bunker and to general westmoreland we have a lot to do yet a great many mistakes have been made we take two steps forward and we slip back one it is not all perfect by any means there are a good many days when we get a c minus instead of an a plus but overall we are making progress we are satisfied with that progress our allies are pleased with that progress every country that i know in that area that is familiar with what is happening thinks it is absolutely essential that uncle sam keep his word and stay there until we can find an honorable peace if they have any doubts about it mr ho chi minh who reads our papers and who listens to our radio who looks at our television if he has any doubts about it i want to disillusion him this morning we keep our commitments our people are going to support the men who are there the men there are going to bring us an honorable peace q mr president hanoi may be interpreting current public opinion polls to indicate that you will be replaced next year how should this affect the campaign in this country the president i don t know how it will affect the campaign in this country whatever interpretation hanoi might make that would lead them to believe that uncle sam whoever may be president is going to pull out and it will be easier for them to make an inside deal with another president then they will make a serious misjudgment q are you going to run next year the president i will cross that bridge when i get to it as i have told you so many times q mr president there are increasing statements from capitol hill that say your tax bill is dead for this session of congress is there any plan on the part of your administration to try and revive this before congress leaves and secondly if not what plans might you have next year to avert this inflationary trend that we are told will be coming the president we want very much to have a tax bill just as quickly as we can get it we think the sound prudent fiscal policy requires it we are going to do everything that the president and the administration can do to get that tax bill i would be less than frank if i didn t tell you that i have no indication whatever that mr mills or mr byrnes or the ways and means committee is likely to report a tax bill before they adjourn i feel that one of our failures in the administration has been our inability to convince the congress of the wisdom of fiscal responsibility and the necessity of passing a tax bill not only for the effect it will have on the inflationary developments but the effect it will have on the huge deficit that we are running i think one of the great mistakes that the congress will make is that mr ford and mr mills have taken this position that they cannot have any tax bill now they will live to rue the day when they made that decision because it is a dangerous decision it is an unwise decision i think that the people of america none of whom want to pay taxes any pollster can walk out and say do you want to pay more tax of course you will say no i don t want to pay tax but if you ask him do you want inflation do you want prices to increase 5 or 6 percent do you want a deficit of 30 or 35 billion do you want to spend 35 billion more than you are taking in i think the average citizen would say no here at the height of our prosperity when our gross national product is going to run at 850 billion when we look at the precedents of what we have done in past wars in korea when president truman asked for a tax increase people supported it this request has been before the congress since last january they have finished most of the appropriations bills i read the story this morning it looks like out of 145 billion they will roughly cut a billion dollars in expenditures but they will cut several billion from revenues because of inaction because people don t like to stand up and do the unpopular thing of assuming responsibility that men in public life are required to do sometime i know it doesn t add to your polls and your popularity to say we have to have additional taxes to fight this war abroad and fight the problems in our cities at home but we can do it with the gross national product we have we should do it and i think when the american people and the congress get the full story they will do it we have failed up to now to be able to convince them but we are going to continue to try in every way that is proper q senator mccarthy has said he is considering opposing you in the presidential primaries because he believes it would be a healthy thing to debate vietnam in the primaries for the party and for the country too do you agree with him what effect do you think this would have on your own candidacy the president i don t know how i am going to be after all this opposition develops so far as my state of health is concerned but i am very healthy today i don t know whether this criticism has contributed to my good health or not i don t know what senator mccarthy is going to do i am not sure that he knows what he plans to do i think we had better just wait and see until there is something definite there and meet it when it is necessary q why do you think there is so much confusion frustration and difference of opinion in this country about the war in vietnam the president there has always been confusion frustration and difference of opinion when there is a war going on there was in the revolutionary war when only about a third of the people thought that was a wise move a third of them opposed it and a third were on the sideline that was true when all of new england came down to secede in madison s administration in the war of 1812 and stopped in baltimore they didn t quite make it because andrew jackson s results in new orleans came in they were having a party there that night the next morning they came and told the president they wanted to congratulate him that they had thought he was right all along although they had come from boston to baltimore in a secessionist move that was true in the mexican war when the congress overwhelmingly voted to go in and later passed a resolution that had grave doubts about it some of the most bitter speeches were made they were so bitter they couldn t be published they had m hold up publication of them for 100 years i don t have to remind you of what happened in the civil war people were here in the white house begging lincoln to concede and work out a deal with the confederacy when word came to him of his victories they told him that pennsylvania was gone that illinois had no chance those pressures come to a president you know what president roosevelt went through and president wilson in world war i he had some senators from certain areas then that gave him very serious problems until victory was assured now when you look back upon it there are very few people who would think that wilson roosevelt or truman were in error we are going to have this criticism we are going to have these differences no one likes war all people love peace but you can t have freedom without defending it q mr president the foreign aid authorization has been cut back nearly a third from what you requested what is the impact of this economy the president at a time when the richest nation in the world is enjoying more prosperity than it has ever had before when we carefully tailor our requests to the very minimum that we think is essential the lowest request that we have had in years and then congress cuts it 33 1 3 percent i think it is a mistake it is a serious mistake when you consider that 1 billion that we are attempting to save there out of the 850 billion that we will produce we ought to reconsider that decision because what we are doing with that money not only can give great help to underdeveloped nations but that in itself can prevent the things that cause war where you are required to spend billions to win it i would rather have a little preventive medicine every dollar that we spend in our foreign assistance trying to help poor people help themselves is money well spent i don t think we overdid it i don t think we went too far but i think the congress has in the reductions it has made again it is popular to go back home and say look what i did for you i cut out all these foreign expenditures but when the trouble develops the people who are starving the people who are ignorant illiterate and diseased and wars spring up and we have to go in we will spend much more than we would if we had taken an ounce of prevention q mr president some people on the air and in print accuse you of trying to label all criticism of your vietnam policy as unpatriotic could you tell us whether you have guidelines in which you are enabled to separate conscientious dissent from irresponsible dissension the president no i haven t called anyone unpatriotic i haven t said anything that would indicate that i think the wicked fleeth when no one pursueth sometimes i do think that some people are irresponsible make untrue statements and ought to be cautious and careful when they are dealing with the problem involving their men at the front there is a great deal of difference as i said a moment ago between criticism indifference and responsible dissent all of which we insist on and all of which we protect and storm trooper bullying throwing yourself down in the road smashing windows rowdyism and every time a person attempts to speak to try to drown him out we believe very strongly in preserving the right to differ in this country and the right to dissent if i have done a good job of anything since i have been president it is to insure that there are plenty of dissenters there is not a person in this press corps that can t write what he wants to write most of them do write what they want to i say want advisedly i want to protect that our congress wants to protect it but if i by chance should say now i am not sure that you saw all the cables on this and you are exactly right let me explain the other side of it i would hope that you wouldn t say i am lambasting my critics or that i am assailing someone what i am trying to do is to preserve my right to give the other side i don t think one side ought to dominate the whole picture so what i would say is let s realize that we are in the midst of a war let s realize that there are 500 000 of our boys out there who are risking their lives to win that war let s ask ourselves what it is we can do to help if you think you can make a contribution and help them by expressing your opinion and dissenting then do it but then if the secretary of state starts to explain his viewpoint don t send out instructions all over the country and say when he starts to talk and says mr chair man stamp your feet when he comes to the end of a sentence all of you do this and at the third sentence all of you boo i am amazed that the press in this country who insist on the right to live by the first amendment and to be protected by it doesn t insist that these storm trooper tactics live by the first amendment too and that they be wiped out i think the time has come when it would be good for all of us to take a new fresh look at dissent we welcome responsible dissent but there is a great deal of difference between responsible dissent and some of the things that are taking place in this country which i consider to be extremely dangerous to our national interest and i consider not very helpful to the men who are fighting the war for us now everyone must make that judgment for himself i have never said anyone was unpatriotic i don t question these people s motives i do question their judgment i can t say that this dissent has contributed much to any victories we have had i can t say that these various proposals that range from a senator to a county commissioner to a mayor of a city have really changed general westmoreland s plan much or ambassador bunker s approach the papers are filled with it every day so i think you have to consider it for what you think it is worth and make your own judgment that is the theory of the first amendment we don t stop the publication of any papers we don t fine anyone for something they say we just appeal to them to remember that they don t have the privilege at the moment of being out there fighting please count to 10 before you say something that hurts instead of helps we know that most people s intentions are good we don t question their motives we have never said they are unpatriotic although they say some pretty ugly things about us people who live in glass houses shouldn t be too anxious to throw stones q mr president is your aim in vietnam to win the war or to seek a compromised negotiated solution the president i think our aims in vietnam have been very clear from the beginning they are consistent with the seato treaty with the atlantic charter and with the many many statements that we have made to the congress in connection with the tonkin gulf resolution the secretary of state has made this clear dozens and dozens of times and i made it enough that i thought even all the preachers in the country had heard about it that is namely to protect the security of the united states we think the security of the united states is definitely tied in with the security of southeast asia secondly to resist aggression when we are a party to a treaty that says we will do it then we carry it out i think if you saw a little child in this room who was trying to waddle across the floor and some big bully came along and grabbed it by the hair and started stomping it i think you would do something about it i think that we thought we made a mistake when we saw hitler moving across the landscape of europe the concessions that were made by the men carrying umbrellas at that time i think in retrospect we thought that was a mistake so as a consequence in 1954 under the leadership of president eisenhower and secretary dulles we had a seato treaty it was debated it was considered and it was gone into very thoroughly by the senate the men who presented that treaty then said this is dangerous the time may come when we may have to put up or shut up but we ought to serve notice in asia now as we refused to serve notice in europe a few years ago that we will resist aggression that we will stand against someone who seeks to gobble up little countries if those little countries call upon us for our help so we did that i didn t vote for that treaty i was in the hospital senator kennedy didn t vote for it the late president he was in the hospital senator dirksen didn t vote for it but 82 senators did vote for it they knew what was in that treaty the time came when we had to decide whether we meant what we said when we said our security was tied in to their security and that we would stand in unison in the face of common danger now we are doing that we are doing it against whoever combines out there to promote aggression we are going to do whatever we think is necessary to protect the security of south vietnam and let those people determine for themselves what kind of a government they have we think they are moving along very quickly in that direction to developing a democratic procedure third we are going to do whatever it is necessary to do to see that the aggressor does not succeed those are our purposes those are our goals we are going to get a lot of advice to do this or to do that we are going to consider it all but for years west point has been turning out the best military men produced anywhere in the world for years we have had in our foreign service trained and specialized people we have in 110 capitals today the best brains we can select under our constitutional arrangements the president must look to his secretary of state to his foreign policy to his ambassadors to the cables and views that they express to his leaders like the joint chiefs of staff and to general westmoreland and others and carefully consider everything they say and then do what he thinks is right that is not always going to please a county commissioner or a mayor or a member of a legislature it never has in any war we have ever been in been a favorite of the senate the leaders on the military committees and the leaders in other posts have frequently opposed it champ clark the speaker of the house opposed the draft in woodrow wilson s administration the chairman of the foreign relations committee with the exception of senator vandenberg almost invariably has found a great deal wrong with the executive in the field of foreign policy there is a division there and there is some frustration there those men express it and they have a right to they have a duty to do it but it is also the president s duty to look and see what substance they have presented how much they thought it out what information they have how much knowledge they have received from general westmoreland or ambassador bunker whoever it is how familiar they are with what is going on and whether you really think you ought to follow their judgment or follow the judgment of the other people i do that every day some days i have to say to our people let us try this plan that senator x has suggested and we do we are doing that with the united nations resolution we have tried several times to get the united nations to play a part in trying to bring peace in vietnam the senate thinks that this is the way to do it more than 50 of them have signed a resolution the senate foreign relations committee had a big day yesterday they reported two resolutions in one day i have my views i have my views about really what those resolutions will achieve but i also have an obligation to seriously and carefully consider the judgments of the other branch of the government and we are going to do it even though we may have some doubts about what will be accomplished that they think may be accomplished if it is a close question we will bend to try to meet their views because we think that is important we have already tried the united nations before but we may try it again because they have hopes and they believe that this is the answer we will do everything that we can to make it the answer i don t want to hurt its chances by giving any predictions at this moment we will consider the views that everyone suggests thank you mr president

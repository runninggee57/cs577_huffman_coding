clinton thank you jim and thank you to the people of hartford our hosts i want to begin by saying again how much i respect senator dole and his record of public service and how hard i will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas not insults four years ago i ran for president at a time of high unemployment and rising frustration i wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all responsibility from all and an american community where everybody has a role to play i wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people have the tools to make the most of their own lives four years ago you took me on faith now there s a record 10 million more jobs rising incomes falling crime rates and welfare rolls a strong america at peace we are better off than we were four years ago let s keep it going we cut the deficit by 60 percent now let s balance the budget and protect medicare medicaid education and the environment we cut taxes for 15 million working americans now let s pass the tax cuts for education and childrearing help with medical emergencies and buying a home we passed family and medical leave now let s expand it so more

able to read every 12 year old can log on to the internet every 18 year old can go to college we can build that bridge to the 21st century and i look forward to discussing exactly how we re going to do it lehrer senator dole two minutes senator bob dole thank you thank you mr president for those kind words and i thank the people of hartford the commission and all those out here who may be listening or watching it s a great honor for me to be here standing here as the republican nominee i m very proud to be the republican nominee reaching out to democrats and independents i have three very special people with me my wife elizabeth my daughter robin who have never let me down and a fellow named frank carafa from new york who along with ollie manninen helped me out in the mountains of italy a few years back i ve learned from them that people do have tough times and sometimes you can t go it alone and that s what america s all about i remember getting my future back from doctors and nurses and a doctor in chicago named dr kelikian and ever since that time i ve tried to give something back to my country to the people who are watching us tonight america is the greatest place on the face of the earth and i know millions of you still have anxieties you work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table you worry about the quality and the safety of your children and the quality of education but even more importantly you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and i have had and jack kemp and i want to share with you some ideas tonight jack kemp is my runningmate doing an outstanding job now i m a plain speaking man and i learned long ago that your word was your bond and i promise you tonight that i ll try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them it s a tall order but i ve been running against the odds for a long time and again i m honored to be here this evening federal government s role lehrer mr president first question there s a major difference in your view of the role of the federal government and that of senator dole how would you define the difference president clinton well jim i believe that the federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives that to me is the key and that leads me to some different conclusions from senator dole for example we have reduced the size of the federal government to its smallest size in 30 years we ve reduced more regulations eliminated more programs than my two republican predecessors but i have worked hard for things like the family and medical leave law the brady bill the assault weapons ban the program to put 100 000 police on the street all of these are programs that senator dole opposed that i supported because i felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives i ve worked hard to help families impart values to their own children i supported the v chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they re young along with the ratings system for television and educational television i supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing advertising and sale of tobacco to young people i supported a big increase in the safe and drug free schools program these were areas on which senator dole and i differed but i believed that they were the right areas for america to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future lehrer senator dole one minute senator dole i think the basic difference is and i have had some experience in this i think the basic difference i trust the people the president trusts the government if you go back and look at the health care plan that he wanted to impose on the american people one seventh the total economy 17 new taxes price controls 35 to 50 new bureaucracies a cost of 1 5 trillion don t forget that that happened in 1993 a tax increase that taxed everybody in america not just the rich if you made 25 000 that s the original proposal you got your social security taxes increased we had a btu tax that turned into a 35 billion gas tax a 265 billion tax increase i guess i rely more on the individual i carry a little card around in my pocket called the 10th amendment where possible i want to give power back to the states and back to the people that s my difference for the present and we ll have specific differences later he noted a few but there are others lehrer mr president 30 seconds president clinton i trust the people we ve done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives but i do think we are right when we try to for example give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital ending these drive by deliveries i think we were right to pass the kassebaum kennedy bill which states you can t lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your family has been sick our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under republican presidents but i do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st century state of the nation lehrer senator dole the president said in his opening statement we are better off today than we were four years ago do you agree senator dole well he s better off than he was four years ago laughter president clinton i agree with that that s right senator dole and i may be better off four years from now but laughter i don t know i look at the slowest growth in a century he inherited a growth of 4 7 4 8 percent now it s down to about 2 4 percent we re going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history we ve got stagnant wages in fact women s wages have dropped 2 2 percent men s wages haven t gone up gone down so we have stagnation we have the highest foreign debt in history and it seems to me that if you take a look are you better off well i guess some may be better off saddam hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago rene preval is probably better off than he was four years ago but are the american people they re working harder and harder and paying more taxes for the first time in history you pay about 40 percent of what you earn more than you spend for food clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration so some may be better off they talk about family income being up that s not true in connecticut family income is down and it s up in some cases because both parents are working one works for the family and one works to pay taxes for the government we re going to give them a tax cut so they can spend more time with their children maybe even take a vacation that s what america is all about lehrer mr president one minute president clinton well let me say first of all in february senator dole acknowledged that the american economy was in the best shape it s been in in 30 years we have 10 million more jobs a faster job growth rate than under any republican administration since the 1920s wages are going up for the first time in a decade we have record number of new small businesses we had the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years all groups of people are growing we had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995 the average family s income has gone up over 1 600 just since our economic plan passed so i think it s clear that we re better off than we were four years ago now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still how can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses to be able to afford health insurance to be able to educate their children that s what i want to focus on but we re clearly better off than we were four years ago as senator dole acknowledged this year lehrer senator dole senator dole i doubt that i acknowledged that this year but in any event i think we just look at the facts we ask the people that are viewing tonight are you better off than you were four years ago it s not whether we re better off it s whether they re better off are you working harder to put food on the table to feed your children are your children getting a better education drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across america crime has gone down but it s because of mayors like rudy giuliani where one third of the drop happened in one city new york city so yes some may be better off but of the people listening tonight the working families who will benefit from our economic package they ll be better off when bob dole is president and jack kemp is vice president medicare reform lehrer mr president senator dole has come pretty close in the last few days to accusing you of lying about his position on medicare reform have you done so president clinton absolutely not let s look at the position first of all remember that in this campaign season since senator dole has been a candidate he has bragged about the fact that he voted against medicare in the beginning in 1965 one of only 12 members he said he did the right thing then he knew it wouldn t work at the time that s what he said then his budget that he passed along with speaker gingrich cut medicare 270 billion more than was necessary to repair the medicare trust fund it would have charged seniors more for out of pocket costs as well as more in premiums because doctors could have charged them more the american hospital association the nurses association the catholic hospital association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the dole gingrich medicare plan that i vetoed and now with this risky 550 billion tax scheme of senator dole s even his own friends his campaign cochair senator d amato says that they can t possibly pay for it without cutting medicare more and cutting social security as well according to him now my balanced budget plan adds 10 years to the life of the medicare trust fund 10 years and we ll have time to deal with the long term problems of the baby boomers but it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut medicare 270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine we always have to reform it over the years but we need someone who believes in it to reform it lehrer senator dole senator dole well i must say i looked back at the vote on medicare in 1965 we had a program called eldercare that also provided drugs and was means tested so people who needed medical attention received it i thought it was a good program but i have supported medicare ever since in fact i used to go home and my mother would tell me said bob all i ve got is my social security and my medicare don t cut it i wouldn t violate anything my mother said in fact we had a conversation about our mothers one day a very poignant conversation in the white house i m concerned about health care i ve had the best health care in government hospitals army hospitals and i know its importance but we ve got to fix it it s his trustees the president s trustees not mine who say it s going to go broke he doesn t fix it for 10 years we ought to appoint a commission just as we did with social security in 1983 when we rescued social security and i was proud to be on that commission along with claude pepper the champion of senior citizens from florida and we can do it again if we take politics out of it stop scaring the seniors mr president you ve already spent 45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart i think it s time to have a truce lehrer mr president president clinton well let me say first of all i d be happy to have a commission deal with this and i appreciate what senator dole did on the 83 social security commission but it won t be possible to do if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co chair senator d amato says he ll have to cut medicare even more than was cut in the bill that i vetoed i vetoed that bill because it cut more medicare and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system my balanced budget plan puts 10 years onto medicare we ought to do that then we can have a commission but senator dole s plans are not good for the country senator dole s tax cut proposal lehrer senator dole speaking of your tax plan do you still think that s a good idea the 15 percent across the board tax cut senator dole oh yes and you ll be eligible laughter president clinton me too senator dole and so will the former president yes laughter president clinton that s good i need it senator dole well the people need it that s the point this is not a wall street tax cut this is a family tax cut this is a main street tax cut fifteen percent across let s take a family making 30 000 a year that s 1 261 now maybe to some in this bushnell memorial that s not a lot of money but people watching tonight with a couple of kids a working family that s four or five months of day care maybe a personal computer it may be three or four months of mortgage payments this economic package is about families but it s a six point package first of all it s a balanced budget amendment to the constitution which president clinton defeated he twisted arms and got six democrats to vote the other way we lost by one vote it s balancing the budget by the year 2002 it s the tax cut cutting capital gains 50 percent so that you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities it s a state tax relief it s a 500 per child tax credit it s about litigation reform now that the president gets millions of dollars from the trial lawyers he probably doesn t like this provision in fact when i fell off that podium in chico before i hit the ground i had a call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying i think we ve got a case here laughter and it s also regulatory reform so it s a good package mr president and we d like to have your support lehrer mr president president clinton well here s the problem with it it sounds very good but there s a reason that 500 economists including seven nobel prize winners and business periodicals like business week and even senator dole s friend senator warren rudman former republican senator from new hampshire says it is not a practical program it s a 550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages car payments credit card payments college loans and small business loans it s not good to raise the deficit we ve worked too hard to lower it it will actually raise taxes on 9 million people and in addition to that it will force bigger cuts in medicare medicaid education and the environment than the ones that he and mr gingrich passed that i vetoed last year so it sounds great but our targeted tax cut for education childrearing health care and homebuying which is paid for in my balanced budget plan something that he has not done certified by the congressional budget office that s the right way to go lehrer senator dole senator dole the president wants to increase spending 20 percent over the next six years i want to increase spending 14 percent that s how simple it is i want the government to pinch pennies for a change instead of the american families we re talking about six percentage points over six years and with that money you give it back to the working people you also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools and it will work and when it does work mr president i know you will congratulate me campaign financing lehrer mr president the senator mentioned trial lawyers and that means campaign financing how do you personally avoid being unduly influenced by people who give you money or give you services in your campaigns president clinton well i try to articulate my positions as clearly as possible tell people what i stand for and let them decide whether they re going to support me or not the senator mentioned the trial lawyers in the case of the product liability bill which they passed and i vetoed i think that s what he s talking about i actually wanted to sign that bill and i told the people exactly what the congress exactly what kind of bill i would sign now a lot of the trial lawyers didn t want me to sign any bill at all but i thought we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuits but they wouldn t make some of the changes that i thought should be made and let me just give you an example i had a person in the oval office who lost a child in a schoolbus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly but there were problems with the schoolbus the drunk driver had no money under the new bill if i had signed it a person like that could never have had any recovery i thought that was wrong so i gave four or five specific examples to the congress and i said prove to me that these people could recover but we re going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits i ll sign the bill but generally i believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right i ve done a lot of things that were controversial my economic plan my trade position bosnia haiti taking on the nra for the first time taking on the tobacco companies for the first time sometimes you just have to do that because you know it s right for the country over the long run that s what i ve tried to do and that s what i will continue to do as president lehrer senator dole senator dole you mean how does he avoid the conflict well i don t know in the case of the trial lawyers when i look at the trial lawyers and when you re a few million short you run out to hollywood and pick up 2 million to 4 million and organized labor comes to washington dc and puts 35 million into the pot now if these aren t special interests then i ve got a lot to learn i was there for a while before i left on june 11th the trial lawyers i don t my wife is a lawyer we re the only two lawyers in washington that trust each other but we re lawyers i like lawyers i don t dislike trial lawyers but it seems to me there has got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits and there s got to be some cap on punitive damage you re putting a lot of business people out of business small business men and small business women who paid 70 percent of your 265 billion tax increase the largest tax increase in the history of america i said that one day and pat moynihan and the democrats say no he said in the history of the world so i modified it the largest tax increase in the history of the world and it seems to me that there is a problem there mr president and i will address you as mr president you didn t do that with president bush in 1992 lehrer mr president president clinton let me say first of all i signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago i ve proved that i will sign reasonable tort reform secondly senator dole has had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money but it wasn t me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who are subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up to the federal government when we tried to stop the advertising marketing and sales of tobacco to children and it wasn t me that let the polluters actually come into the halls of congress into the rooms and rewrite the environmental laws that s what speaker gingrich and senator dole did not me senator dole that s not true president clinton so i believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other s motivations i think senator dole and i just honestly disagree lehrer well senator dole let me ask you the same question i asked the president how do you avoid being influenced by people who contribute money and services to your campaigns senator dole i think it s very difficult let s be honest about it that s why we need campaign finance reform that s why i reach out to the perot voters and we ve done about all that we are the reform party the republican party and the perot voters who are looking for a home ought to take a look at the republican record whatever it is whatever the checklist was in 92 it s all done but campaign finance reform i worked with senator mitchell who played me i guess in the debate warmup we tried six or eight years ago to he appointed three people i appointed three people to get campaign finance reform we couldn t get it done because it wasn t enforceable you suggested a commission newt gingrich did i ve suggested that at least four or five years ago we have a commission on campaign finance reform they send it to congress and we have to vote it up or down that s how it works we re never going to fix it by the parties because democrats want a better advantage for themselves we want a better advantage as republicans and that s not how it s going to work but i want to touch on this tobacco thing i know the president s been puffing a lot on that but i want to go back to 1965 that was my first vote against tobacco companies when i said we ought to label cigarettes and i ve had a consistent record ever since 1965 we passed a bill in 1992 to encourage the states to adopt programs to stop kids from smoking all 50 states did it it took three years it wasn t until election year mr president that you ever thought about stopping smoking what about drugs that have increased doubled in the last 44 months cocaine is up 141 percent or marijuana cocaine up 166 percent and it seems to me that you have a selective memory mine doesn t work that way so i just want to try to correct it as we go along lehrer mr president president clinton mr lehrer i hope we ll have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program but let me respond to what you said i agree that too many incumbent politicians in washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform that was certainly the case from the minute i got there so after speaker gingrich and senator dole took over the congress i went to new hampshire and a man suggested a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago suggested that we appoint a commission and i shook hands with him on it and i appointed my members and the commission never met and then senator dole s ardent supporter senator mccain who is out there today along with senator feingold supported sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal i strongly supported it and members of senator dole s own party in the senate killed it and he was not out there urging them to vote for the mccain feingold bill so i think the american people including the perot supporters know that i ve had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform and i will continue to have and i hope we can finally get it in the next session of congress because we need it badly lehrer senator dole 30 seconds senator dole well on campaign reform itself we re going to get it when we have a bipartisan commission take it out of politics get people who don t have any interest in politics but understand the issue and let them make a recommendation to congress now we re not kidding anybody mr president these are sophisticated people watching tonight millions and millions of americans they know the republican party hasn t done it they know the democratic party won t do it we ought to agree that somebody else should do it and then we have to vote it up or down president clinton i agree teenage drug use lehrer mr president the senator mentioned drugs he s suggested in the past that you bear some responsibility for the rise in drug use of teenagers in the united states is he right president clinton well jim i think every american in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what s happened i am but let s look at the overall record overall in america cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years casual drug use down 13 percent the tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana and i regret it let me tell you what i ve tried to do about it i appointed a four star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation s drug czar the most heavily decorated soldier in uniform when he retired we submitted the biggest drug budget ever we have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border we supported a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including the death penalty for drug kingpins and i supported a big expansion in the safe and drug free schools program to support things like the d a r e program because i thought all those things were very important do i think that i bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don t understand drugs are wrong drugs can kill you even though i have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them i think we all do and i hope we can do better i don t think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and i don t think senator dole supports using drugs i think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn t dangerous and won t kill them and won t destroy their lives get the message and change lehrer senator senator dole again you re very selective mr president you don t want to politicize drugs but it s all right to politicize medicare and go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups veterans and people who get pell grants and things like this i mean you say we have done all these bad things which isn t the case but it seems to me the record is clear the record was pretty clear in arkansas when you were governor drug use doubled you resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment but here you cut the drug czar s office 83 percent you have cut interdiction substantially that s what i want to stop it from coming across the border and in my administration we re going to train the national guard to stop it from coming across the border this is an invasion of drugs from all over the world and we have a responsibility you had a surgeon general mccaffrey you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs is that the kind of leadership we need and i won t comment on other things that have happened in your administration or your past about drugs but it seems to me the kids ought to if they have started they ought to stop and just don t do it lehrer mr president president clinton let me say again we did have a drug czar in arkansas but he answered to the governor just like this one answers to the president that s what i thought we ought to do secondly senator dole you voted against the crime bill that had the death penalty for drug kingpins in it and you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug free schools act i don t think that means you re soft on drugs we just have a different approach but let me remind you that my family has suffered from drug abuse i know what it s like to see somebody you love nearly lose their lives and i hate drugs senator we need to do this together and we can gun control lehrer senator dole on the government continuing to talk about the government s role if elected president would you seek to repeal the brady bill and the ban on assault weapons senator dole not if i didn t have a better idea but i ve got a better idea it s something i ve worked on for 15 years it s called the automated check or the instant check it s being used in 17 states right now states like florida colorado virginia and other states you don t buy any gun you don t get any gun we ve got 20 million names on a computer in washington dc of people who should not have a gun we ought to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and there are eight other categories that should not have guns i ve been working on this for a long long time you walk in you put your little card in there if it says tilt you don t get any gun you don t get a handgun you don t get a rifle you don t get a shotgun you get zippo if we re going to protect american children and american families and people who live as prisoners in their own home we ve got to stop guns from being dumped on the street the administration says they support the instant check they ve appropriated about 200 million but only spent about 3 million to get it underway in our administration in my administration we will expedite this it keeps up the technology it keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have guns that is the bottom line and i believe it s a good idea it has strong bipartisan support and perhaps that s another thing we can depoliticize you talk about the brady bill there s only been one prosecution under the brady bill only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the brady bill that you talk about all the time and on the assault weapons ban out of 17 weapons that were banned only six are banned now because 11 have been modified and they re back on the street let s get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference lehrer mr president president clinton the president let me say first of all senator dole has gone back and forth about whether he d be for repealing the brady bill or repealing the assault weapons ban and i think his present position is that he would not do so and if that s true i m grateful for it but let s look at the facts here the brady bill has kept at least 60 000 felons fugitives and stalkers from getting handguns senator dole led the fight against the brady bill he tried to keep it from coming to my desk he didn t succeed and i signed it and i m glad i did then when we had the assault weapons ban in the senate senator dole fought it bitterly and opposed the entire crime bill and almost brought the entire crime bill down because the national rifle association didn t want the assault weapons ban just like they didn t want the brady bill but two years later nobody has lost their handguns i mean their rifles we ve expanded the brady bill to cover people who beat up their spouses and their kids and this is a safer country so i m glad i took on that fight and i believe with all respect i was right and he was wrong senator dole well the president doesn t have it quite right i mean it seemed to me at the time that the assault weapon ban was not effective but that s history as i told the nra that s history you re not going to worry about it anymore i m not going to worry about it anymore let s do something better let s stop playing the political game mr president talking about this and this you add up all the states who have used the instant check and how many weapons they ve kept out of the hands of criminals it would far surpass the number you mentioned so in my view if you want to be protected you ought to vote for bob dole and we ll get the instant check passed and we ll keep guns out of the hands of criminals foreign policy lehrer mr president senator dole said the other day that you practiced a photo op foreign policy that has lessened the credibility of the united states throughout the world is he wrong about that president clinton if that s what he said he s not right about that look at where we are today the united states is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the cold war and on the brink of the 21st century i have worked to support our country as the world s strongest force for peace and freedom prosperity and security we have done the following things number one we ve managed the aftermath of the cold war supporting a big drop in nuclear weapons in russia the removal of russian troops from the baltics the integration of central and eastern european democracies into a new partnership with nato and i might add with a democratic russia there are no nuclear missiles pointed at the children of the united states tonight and have not been in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age we have worked hard for peace and freedom when i took office haiti was governed by a dictator that had defied the united states when i took office the worst war in europe was waging in bosnia now there is a democratically elected president in haiti peace in bosnia we have just had elections there we have made progress in northern ireland and the middle east we ve also stood up to the new threats of terrorism the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction organized crime and we have worked hard to expand america s economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest number of new trade agreements in history that s one of the reasons america is number one in auto production again lehrer senator senator dole well i have a different view again i ve supported the president on bosnia and i think we were told the troops would be out in a year now i understand it s been extended til sometime next year but let s start with somalia where they dragged americans through the streets and where 18 americans were killed one day because they didn t have they were pinned down for eight hours the rangers they didn t have the weapons they didn t have the tanks they asked for the tanks they didn t get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building it s called mission creep we turn it over to the united nations the president didn t have much to do about it look at haiti where we ve spent about 3 billion and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago you ve got to send down some more people because the president has found out there are death squads on his own property so we need more protection from america bosnia northern ireland there is no cease fire in bosnia i think there are still lots of problems in bosnia we agreed to train and arm the muslims so they could defend themselves the policy you had when you ran in 1992 we haven t done that we re way behind which means americans can t come home americans shouldn t have gone there in the first place had we let them defend themselves as they have a right to do under article 57 of the united nations charter lehrer mr president president clinton first of all i take full responsibility for what happened in somalia but the american people must remember that those soldiers were under an american commander when that happened i believe they did the best they could under the circumstances and let s not forget that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved there secondly in haiti political violence is much much smaller than it was thirdly in bosnia it s a virtual miracle that there has been no return to war and at least there has now been an election and the institutions are beginning to function in northern ireland and the middle east we are better off than we were four years ago there will always be problems in this old world but if we re moving in the right direction and america is leading we re better off lehrer senator dole if elected president what criteria would you use to decide when to send u s troops into harm s way senator dole well after world war i we had a policy of disengagement then from world war i to world war ii we had sort of a compulsory engagement policy now i think we have to have a selective engagement policy we have to determine when our interests are involved not the united nations interests and many of the things the president talked about he turned over to the united nations they decided he s deployed more troops than any president in history around the world it s cost us billions and billions of dollars for peacekeeping operations these are facts and it seems to me that when you make a decision the decision is made by the president of the united states by the commander in chief he makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go around and defend our liberty and our freedom that would be my position then i m going to have a top down review at the pentagon not a bottom up review where you all fight over how much money is there i want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all of the services fighting for the money the president said he was going to cut defense 60 billion he cut defense 112 billion devastated states like california and others and i think now we ve got a problem we ve got to go back and look it s just like you said in texas one day you know you raised taxes too much and you did and you cut defense too much mr president and you did and you may have said that too but the bottom line is we are the strongest nation in the world we provide the leadership and we re going to have to continue to provide the leadership but let s do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows a whistle at the united nations president clinton our military is the strongest military in the world it is the strongest best prepared best equipped it has ever been there is very little difference in the budget that i have proposed and the republican budget over the next six year period we are spending a lot of money to modernize our weapons system i have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers for our men and women in uniform for their families for their training that is my solemn obligation you asked when do you decide to deploy them the interests of the american people must be at stake our values must be at stake we have to be able to make a difference and frankly we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform but i believe the evidence is that our deployments have been successful in haiti in bosnia when we moved to kuwait to repel saddam hussein s threatened invasion of kuwait when i have sent the fleet into the taiwan straits when we ve worked hard to end the north korean nuclear threat i believe the united states is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined careful effective deployment of our military resources lehrer senator dole senator dole well i failed to mention north korea and cuba a while ago you look at north korea where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs where we ve sort of distanced ourselves from our allies south korea they lost about a million people in the war the korean war the forgotten war we lost 53 000 americans we shouldn t be doing any favors for north korea it s a closed society we don t have any inspection we don t know whether it s going to work or not but we keep giving them these incentives some would call them something else incentives we don t know what s going to happen here we have cuba 90 miles from our shores and what have we done we ve passed a law that gave people the right to sue and the president postponed it for six months and it seems to me if you want to send a signal you ve got to send a signal mr president the sooner the better off we ll be if we put tougher sanctions on castro not try to make it easier for him cuba lehrer well mr president what is your attitude toward cuba and how cuba should be treated president clinton well first of all for the last four years we have worked hard to put more and more pressure on the castro government to bring about more openness and a move toward democracy in 1992 before i became president congress passed the cuba democracy act and i enforced it vigorously we made the embargo tougher but we increased contacts people to people with the cubans including direct telephone service which was largely supported by the cuban american community then cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international airspace they were completely beyond the pale of the law and i signed the helms burton legislation senator dole is correct i did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed even though they re effective now and can be legally binding because i want to change cuba and the united states needs help from other countries nobody in the world agrees with our policy on cuba now but this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move cuba to democracy every single country in latin america central america and the caribbean is a democracy tonight but cuba and if we stay firm and strong we will be able to bring cuba around as well senator dole well that s the point i made we have to be firm and strong and i hope that will happen it will happen starting next january and maybe can happen the balance of this year we have not been firm and strong if you look at the poor people who still live in cuba it s a haven for drug smugglers and we don t have a firm policy when it comes to fidel castro in my view the policy has failed so congress passes a law the president signs it like he does a lot of things but he like welfare reform well i m going to sign it but i m going to try to change it next year i mean a lot of these election year conversions the president is talking about all the drug money and all the other things all this antismoking campaign all happened in 1996 and i think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment when he gave you that biggest tax increase in history when he tried to take over your health care system when he fought regulatory reform that costs the average family 6 000 to 7 000 a year this is serious business it s about your family it s about your business and in this case it s about a firmer policy with cuba president clinton there were several off the subject whoppers in that litany let me just mention senator dole voted for 900 billion in tax increases his runningmate jack kemp once said that bob dole never met a tax he didn t hike laughter and everybody knows including the wall street journal hardly a friend of the democratic party or this administration that the 82 tax increase he sponsored in inflation adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in american history so we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here health care reform lehrer senator dole you mentioned health reform several times what do you think should be done about the health care system senator dole let me first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut you know we were closing loopholes we were going after big corporations i know you probably would oppose it mr president but i think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system and we will have a fairer flatter system and we re going to make the economic package work health care well we finally passed the kassebaum bill the president was opposed to it in 1993 he wanted to give us this big system that took over about one seventh the economy that put on price controls created all these state alliances and would cost 1 5 trillion and force people into managed care whether they wanted it or not most people want to see their own doctor they re going to see their own doctor when bob dole is president we won t threaten anybody so we passed the kassebaum kennedy bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people we ve been for that for four five or six years the president held it up and even when it finally got near passage senator kennedy held it up for 100 days because he wasn t satisfied with one provision but it will cover a pre existing condition if you change your job you re going to be covered so there are a lot of good things in this bill that we should have done instead of trying this massive massive takeover by the federal government but then of course you had a democratic congress and they didn t want to do that until we got a republican congress we finally got action and i m very proud of my colleagues in the republican party for getting that done it means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight president clinton well that sounds very good but it s very wrong senator dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a health care bill in 1994 but instead to work with the senate republicans and write a joint bill and they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid health care before the 94 elections so they could make that claim well maybe we bit off more than we could chew but we re pursuing a step by step reform now the kennedy kassebaum bill that i signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family has been sick i signed a bill to stop these drive by deliveries where insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and i vetoed senator dole s medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to medicare withering on the vine lehrer senator senator dole well many of the provisions in the kassebaum bill were provisions my provisions like deductions for long term care making certain that self employed people who are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of what you pay for premiums you can also deduct long term care now so it s a good start i think we re even looking at our tax cut proposal our economic package there may be a way there to reach out to the uninsured because there are a lot of uninsured people in this country particularly children that should be covered another way you can do it is to expand medicaid in america no one will go without health care no one will go without food lehrer senator go ahead and finish your sentence sorry senator dole food laughter iraq lehrer back to foreign affairs for a moment mr president are you satisfied with the way you handled this last iraq crisis and the end result president clinton well i believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances saddam hussein is under a u n resolution not to threaten his neighbors or repress his own citizens unfortunately a lot of people have never been as concerned about the kurds as the united states has tried to be and we ve been flying an operation to protect them out of turkey for many years now what happened was one of the kurdish leaders invited him to go up north but we felt since the whole world community had told him not to do it that once he did it we had to do something we did not feel that i could commit i certainly didn t feel i should commit american troops to throw him out of where he had gone and that was the only way to do that so the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors we did that by expanding what s called the no fly zone by increasing our allies control of the airspace now from the kuwait border to the suburbs of baghdad was it the right thing to do i believe it was is it fully effective did it make him withdraw from the north well he has a little bit and i hope he will continue we have learned that if you give him an inch he ll take a mile we had to do something and even though not all of our allies supported it at first i think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do lehrer senator dole senator dole well the president s own cia director says that saddam is stronger now than he was and i don t understand extending the no fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north and what we ve done during the bush administration the kurds were at the state department negotiating trying to work their differences out now we ve got all thousands and thousands of refugees we re even shipping i guess 3 000 kurds to guam it involves turkey it s a real problem and saddam is probably stronger than he ever was we shot what 44 cruise missiles they re worth about 1 2 million apiece and hit some radar that repaired in a couple three days did we inflict any damage no did we have any of our allies helping well we have great britain they re always very loyal to us and i appreciate that and of course kuwait even though they had to find out they had 5 000 troops coming they didn t even understand that we had to get their permission the bottom line is we went in there alone we re supposed to be operating under a u n resolution we did it without any of our allies that helped us in the gulf president clinton senator dole has two or three times before tonight criticized me for working with the u n now i m being criticized for not working with the u n senator dole that s not the u n president clinton sometimes the united states has to act alone or at least has to act first sometimes we cannot let other countries have a veto on our foreign policy i could not send soldiers into the north of iraq that would have been wrong i could reduce saddam hussein s ability to threaten kuwait and his other neighbors again that s what i did i still believe it was the right thing to do middle east peace process lehrer senator dole on your photo op foreign policy charge against the president senator dole not mine lehrer no no i mean your charge against the president that he has a photo op foreign policy does the middle east summit last week fall into that category senator dole well there were some good pictures but does it fall into that category i don t know i want to be very serious i have supported the president when i thought he was right on bosnia i supported him on nafta and gatt so it s not that we always disagree others disagreed with us the mideast is very difficult but it seemed to me just as an observer that before you would call somebody to america you would have some notion what the end result might be now maybe it s better just to get together and sit down and talk maybe that was the purpose and i know talks have inaudible started again today but again it s almost like an ad hoc foreign policy it s ad hoc it s sort of well we get up in the morning and read the papers and what country s in trouble we ll have a meeting to me that s not the strategy that i think that people expect from america i think we have lost credibility and i say this very honestly without any partisanship we ve lost credibility around the world our allies don t they re not certain what we re going to do what our reaction what our response is going to be nobody suggested sending troops to iraq if that was the hint there from the president but i do think that saddam hussein is stronger than he was and i do believe that we didn t gain a great deal in the mideast by bringing three of the four leaders one refused to come to washington dc president clinton we have a very consistent policy in the middle east it is to support the peace process to support the security of israel and to support those who are prepared to take risks for peace it is a very difficult environment the feelings are very strong there are extremists in all parts of the middle east who want to kill that peace process prime minister rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace i would liked to have had a big organized summit but those people were killing each other rapidly innocent arab children innocent israeli people they were dying so much trust has broken down in the aftermath of the change of government i felt that if i could just get the parties together to say let s stop the violence start talking commit to the negotiations that would be a plus now today the secretary of state is in the middle east and they ve started negotiations and all of those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again lehrer senator dole senator dole well i was disappointed the president did not call for an unconditional end to the violence i mean it seemed to me the violence would stop when these leaders came to america the killing and the tragedies had taken place and it s unfortunate and it is a difficult area no doubt about it it shouldn t be politicized in any way by the president or by his opponent and i don t intend to politicize it i hope that they have talked and i hope they ve reached some result and that the killing will end vision for the future lehrer mr president in your acceptance speech in chicago you said the real choice in this race is quote whether we build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past about whether we believe our best days are still out there or our best days are behind us about whether we want a country of people all working together or one where you re on your own end quote are you saying that you believe senator dole is a man of the past and if elected president he would lead the country backward president clinton well i m saying that senator dole said in his fine speech in san diego that he wanted to build a bridge to the past and i think i know what he meant by that he is troubled as i am by some of the things that go on today but i believe america is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge the barriers of the present always moving into the future that s why when i became president i was determined to kind of move beyond this old stale debate that had gone on in washington for too long to get this country moving again and that s why we ve got a country with 10 million more jobs and record numbers of new businesses and rising incomes and falling crime rates and welfare roll rates that s why we re moving in the right direction and i m trying to emphasize that what i want to do is to continue to do that that s why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy that s why i want a tax cut for education and childrearing but it s got to be paid for that s why i want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again these are my commitments i am very oriented toward the future i think this election has to be geared toward the future i think america s best days are still ahead but we ve got to build the right bridge lehrer senator dole senator dole you know the president reminds me sometimes of my brother kenny who is no longer alive but kenny was a great talker and he used to tell me things that i knew were not quite accurate so we always had a rule we divided by six now maybe in your case maybe just two but 11 million new jobs and everything i mean the president can t take credit for everything that governors are doing or that s happening in new york city when it comes to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad things that happen whether it s drug use or something else in america and so it seems to me that we can talk about well we called kenny the great exaggerator because he just liked to make it sound a little better it made him feel better when it comes to bridges i want a bridge to the future i also want a bridge to the truth we have to tell the truth we ve got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth and the truth is there s a lot wrong with america we need a strong economic package we need a tax cut we need the 500 child credit and we ll have that soon lehrer mr president president clinton i do not for a moment think i m entitled to all the credit for the good things that have happened in america but where i have moved to work with the american people to help them have the tools to make the most of their own lives i think i should get some credit for that i also personally took responsibility tonight when senator dole asked me about the drug problem but you know i think my ideas are better for the future senator dole voted against student loans against head start against creating the department of education if he gets elected president we ll start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the president representing education and our children i personally don t think that s the right kind of future for america and i think we ought to take a different tack education lehrer senator dole do you still favor eliminating the department of education senator dole yes i didn t favor it when it was started i voted against it it was a tribute after president carter s election to the national education association who sent a lot of delegates to the democratic convention who give 99 5 percent of their money to democrats and the president and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools so what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships now some say oh you re republican you can t be reaching out to these people i ve reached out to people all my life i ve worked on the food stamp program proudly and the wic program and the school lunch program with senators like george mcgovern hubert humphrey and others to name a few of my democratic friends i m not some extremist out here i care about people i have my own little foundation that s raised about 10 million for the disabled i don t advertise it just did haven t before i try to do a lot of things that i think might be helpful to people so it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the department of education put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little landel shakespeare out in cleveland ohio and tell your mother and father you re going to get to go to school because we re going to match what the state puts up and you re going to get to go to the school of your choice i don t fault the president or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools i applaud them for it i don t criticize them but why shouldn t everybody have that choice why shouldn t low income americans and low middle income americans i m excited about it it s going to be a big big opportunity for a lot of people president clinton let me say first of all i m all for students having more choices we ve worked hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill there are funds for 3 000 new schools created by teachers and parents sometimes by business people called charter schools that have no rules they re free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children the ones that are out there are doing well what i m against is senator dole s plan to take money away from all of the children we now help with limited federal funds and help far fewer if we re going to have a private voucher plan that ought to be done at the local level or the state level but senator dole has consistently opposed federal help to education he voted against student loans he voted against my improved student loan plan he voted against the national service bill against the head start bill he voted against our efforts in safe and drug free schools he has voted against these programs he does not believe it that s the issue ninety percent of our kids are out there in those public schools and we need to lift their standards and move them forward with the programs like those i ve outlined in this campaign senator dole i had better correct the president i don t know what time it is but it s probably getting late but i want to correct all of these things i voted against they were probably part of some big package that had a lot of pork in it or a lot of things that we shouldn t have had and we probably voted no i ve supported all of the education programs i ve supported head start i think we ought to look at it so i don t want anybody out there to think that we ve just been voting no no no let s give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in america and let them go to better schools let s turn the schools back to the teachers and back to the parents and take it away from the national education association lehrer mr president what s wrong with the school choice proposal president clinton i support school choice i support school choice i have advocated expansions of public school choice alternatives and i said the creation of 3 000 new schools that we are going to help the states to finance but if you re going to have a private voucher plan that ought to be determined by states and localities where they re raising and spending most of the money i simply think it s wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids 90 percent of them are in the public schools to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program that are helping to fund the other programs that are helping our schools to improve their standards our schools are getting better and our schools can be made to be even better still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level i have been a strong force for reform and senator i remind you that a few years ago when i supported a teacher testing law in my home state i was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association i just don t believe we ought to be out there running down teachers and attacking them the way you did at the republican convention i think we ought to be lifting them up and moving our children forward and let me just say that budget you passed that i vetoed would have cut 50 000 kids out of head start it would have eliminated the americorps plan and it would have cut back on student loans and scholarships now it would have that s a fact that s one of the big reasons i vetoed it we need to be doing more in education not less senator dole well the americorps program i must say if that s one of your successes i wouldn t speak about it too loudly it s cost about 27 000 to pay people to volunteer we ve got four million young people volunteering every year the number hasn t gone down and you pick out 20 000 whether they need the money or not and they get paid for volunteering i like young people i like teachers i m a product of public schools you attended a private school for some time in your life i like teachers you re not for school choice you can t be for school choice because it s that special interest money again when you re getting 99 5 percent of the money we don t know what happened to the other 5 percent we re looking for it somebody got it but it all went to democrats and this is part of that liberal establishment one of those liberal things that you just can t do you re for school uniforms and curfews and you re opposed to truancy now that s not reform mr president why can t landel shakespeare in cleveland or pilar gonzalez in milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school some schools aren t safe some schools aren t even safe your choice is nothing let s give them a real choice the kind of choice you have and the kind of choice a lot of people have in america if we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy let s start with education president clinton first of all senator dole let s set the record straight i was able for two years when i was a very young boy to go to a catholic school but i basically went to public schools all my life and i ve worked hard for a long time to make them better ninety percent of our kids are there it s amazing to me you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools where we don t have very much money at the federal level to spend on education we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help if a local school district in cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private school choice plan like milwaukee did let them have at it i might say the results are highly ambiguous but i want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and that s why i vetoed the budget that you passed with 30 billion in education cuts it was wrong and my plan for the future is better political philosophy lehrer mr president senator dole at the republican convention you said the following and i quote it is demeaning to the nation that within the clinton administration a corps of the elite who never grew up never did anything real never sacrificed never suffered and never learned should have the power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self serving schemes end quote whom precisely and what precisely did you have in mind senator dole i had precisely in mind a lot of the people that were in the white house and other agencies who have never been had any experience who came to washington without any experience they re all very liberal of course or they wouldn t be in the administration and their idea was that they knew what was best for the american people now i feel very strongly about a lot of things i feel strongly about education i want to help young people have an education just as i had an education after world war ii with the gi bill of rights and we ve had millions of young men and women in subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education now the reason they don t want to have you know the reason the president can t support this is pretty obvious it s not taking anything away from schools it s new money it s not going to be taken away from anybody else except it will downsize the department of education but this is a very liberal administration this is the administration that gave you the big tax cut this is the administration that tried to take over health care and impose a governmental system this is the administration that fought regulatory reform and that s putting a lot of small business men and small business women out of business this is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice and the list goes on and on and on that s what i had in mind i want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand america there won t be 10 millionaires and 14 lawyers in the cabinet they ll be people with experience and people who understand america and people who know the hard knocks in life president clinton when senator dole made that remark about all the elitists young elitists in the administration one of the young men who works for me who grew up in a house trailer looked at me and said mr president i know how you grew up who is he talking about and you know this liberal charge that s what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race it s sort of their golden oldie you know it s a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear laughter and i just don t think that dog will hunt this time the american people should make up their own mind here s the record we cut the deficit four years in a row for the first time since before the civil war i mean before world war ii and maybe before the civil war too laughter we ve got 10 million new jobs we ve got record numbers of new small businesses we made every one of them eligible for a tax cut we ve got declining crime rates two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties 100 000 police and the assault weapons ban the american people can make up their mind about whether that s a liberal record or a record that s good for america liberal conservative you put whatever label you want on it senator dole well i think it s pretty liberal i ll put that label on it when you take a look at all the programs you ve advocated mr president thank goodness we had a republican congress there the first thing you did when you came into office was send up a stimulus package that said we ve got a little pork we want to scatter around america 16 billion and even some in your own party couldn t buy that i remember talking by the telephone i m not even certain you were too excited about it i ll never repeat what i talk with the president about but in any event we saved the taxpayers 16 billion and then came some other programs and then came health care and then came the tax increase and a lot of these things just stopped in 1994 because then the congress changed and i think we ve done a good job lehrer mr president if you re not a liberal describe your political philosophy president clinton i believe that the purpose of politics is to give people the tools to make the most of their own lives to reinforce the values of opportunity and responsibility and to build a sense of community so we re all working together i don t believe in discrimination i believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy i believe that we have to do these things with a government that s smaller and less bureaucratic but that we have to do them nonetheless it s inconvenient for senator dole but the truth is i ve reduced the size of government more than my republican predecessors and i did stop them i admit that i sure stopped their budget their budget cut enforcement for the environmental protection agency by a third it cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump by a third it ended the principle of the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent their budget weakened our support for education 30 billion even cut funds for scholarships and college loans their budget cut 270 billion in medicare and finally their budget withdrew the national guarantee of health care to poor children families with children with handicaps the elderly in nursing homes poor pregnant women it was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won t make it right it was a bad decision for america and would have been bad for our future if i hadn t stopped it senator dole well the president can define himself in any way he wants but i think we have to look at the record go back to the time he was what texas director for george mcgovern george mcgovern is a friend of mine so i don t mean but he was a liberal proud liberal i ve just finished reading a book i think it s called what is it the demise of the democratic party by ronald radosh or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration whether it s organized labor or whether it s the hollywood elite or whether it s some of the media elite or whether it s the labor unions or whatever and so i think you take a look at it but the bottom line is this i think the american people probably lose sight of all of these bills and all these things they want to know what s going to happen to them they ve all got a lot of anxieties out there did anybody complain when you raised taxes did anybody go out and ask the people how are you going to pay the extra money that s why we want an economic package we want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies that s what our message is to people watching not all this back and forth you voted this way you voted that way we want a better america as we go into the next century president clinton the way to get a better america is to balance the budget and protect medicare medicaid education and the environment to give a targeted tax cut and let me talk about the education tax cut to let people have a 10 000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year any kind of college tuition to give families a tax credit a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody and then to let people save in an ira and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education homebuying or medical expenses that s the right way to go into the 21st century balance the budget and cut taxes not balloon with this 550 billion tax scheme personal differences lehrer senator dole we ve talked mostly now about differences between the two of you that relate to policy issues and that sort of thing are there also significant differences in the more personal area that are relevant to this election senator dole let me say first on the president s promise for another tax cut i mean i ve told people as i travel around all of you who got the tax cut he promised last time vote for him in 96 and not many hands go up so the question is would you buy a used election promise from my opponent the people want economic reform they re having a hard time making ends meet you got one parent working for the government the other parent working for the family and this is important business this is about getting the economy moving again this is about american jobs and opportunities it s about the government as i said before pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer when they raise your taxes nobody runs around asking people where are you going to get the extra money i think the government can do better lehrer are there personal differences that are relevant to this senator dole well my blood pressure is lower and my weight my cholesterol but i will not make health an issue in this campaign laughter i think he s a bit taller than i am but i think there are personal differences i mean i don t like to get into personal matters as far as i m concerned this is a campaign about issues it s about my vision for america and about his liberal vision for america and not about personal things and i think his liberal vision is a thing of the past i know he wants to disown it i wouldn t want to be a liberal either mr president but you re stuck with it because that s your record it s your record in arkansas the biggest tax increase in history the biggest crime increase in history biggest drug increase in history in arkansas lehrer mr president president clinton well just for the record when i was a governor we had the lowest second lowest tax burden of any state in the country the highest job growth rate of any state when i ran for president and were widely recognized for a lot of other advances but the important thing is what are we going to do now i think a targeted tax cut is better for our future targeted to education and childrearing with the rest of the education plan hooking up all of our classrooms to the internet by the year 2000 making sure we ve got an army of reading volunteers trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our 8 year olds can learn to read investing in our environment cleaning up two thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps those plans are better than this 550 billion tax scheme now remember folks even senator dole s campaign cochair senator d amato says he s got to cut medicare to pay for this everybody who has looked at it 500 economists seven nobel prize winners say it s bad for the economy it s going to blow a hole in the deficit raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one i vetoed our plan is better it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families senator dole well i m really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with al d amato and i know he appreciates it laughter you didn t even have tax cuts in your budget mr president the first two years you were president it wasn t until we had a republican congress that you even thought about you talked about tax cuts and getting back to personal differences i think jim if you re a little more specific but i think the president could clarify one thing tonight and that s the question of pardons i know you talked about it with jim lehrer on the pbs show and i ve never discussed whitewater as i ve told you personally i m not discussing whitewater now but i am discussing a power the president has to grant pardons and hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest lehrer mr president president clinton well first of all he made that remark about senator d amato he s arranged for me to spend a lot more time with senator d amato in the last couple of years and so i m more familiar with his comments than i used to be laughter let me say what i ve said already about this pardon issue this is an issue they brought up there has been no consideration of it no discussion of it i ll tell you this i will not give anyone special treatment and i will strictly adhere to the law and that is what every president has done as far as i know in the past but whatever other presidents have done this is something i take seriously and that s my position senator dole but it seems to me the president shouldn t have any comment at all particularly where it s someone where you ve had business dealings i mean you may be sending a signal i don t know i m not questioning anybody but as the president of the united states when somebody asks you about pardons you say no comment period and i think he made a mistake and i think when you make a mistake you say i made a mistake but apparently his position hasn t changed if there are other specific areas but beyond that i haven t gotten into any of these things as the president knows we ve had that discussion and again i know senator d amato i think may have had a hearing or two on whitewater i can t remember laughter but he s not my general chairman he s a friend of mine and so is senator kennedy a friend of yours president clinton you bet senator dole i remember one day on the floor i said now gentlemen let me tax your memories and kennedy jumped up and said why haven t we thought of that before laughter one of your liberal friends president clinton that s right thank you lehrer mr president 30 seconds president clinton no comment laughter senator dole what s the subject matter laughter lehrer senator dole if you could single out one thing that you would like for the voters to have in their mind about president clinton on a policy matter or a personal matter what would it be something to know about him understand it and appreciate it senator dole see if i say anything it s going to be misconstrued i don t think this is even a race between the two it s about our vision for america i happen to like president clinton personally i m addressing him all evening as mr president i said in 1992 he didn t extend that courtesy to president bush but i respect the presidency i ve served under a number of presidents they all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses so i d rather talk about my strengths i think i have my strengths i think the best thing going for bob dole is that bob dole keeps his word it s a question between trust and fear and i would say i think mr president about all you ve got going in this campaign is fear you re spending millions and millions of dollars in negative ads frightening senior citizens i know this to be a fact because i had one tell me last week senator don t cut my medicare i m trying to save your medicare just as i rescued social security with a bipartisan commission i have relatives on medicare i used to sign welfare checks for my grandparents i know all about poverty and all about need and all about taking care of people and that s been my career in the united states senate and i ll keep my word on the economic package if i couldn t cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time i wouldn t look you in the eye tonight in your living room or wherever you may be and say that this is good for america people will tell you who have served with bob dole agree or disagree he kept his word that s what this race is all about president clinton i d like the american people to know that i have worked very hard to be on their side and to move this country forward and we re better off than we were four years ago but the most important thing is my plan for the 21st century is a better plan a targeted tax cut a real commitment to educational reform a deep commitment to making welfare reform work with incentives to the private sector to move people from welfare to work now we have to create those jobs now that we re requiring people to go to work a commitment to step by step health care reform with the next step helping people who are between jobs to access health care and not lose it just because they re out of work for a while a commitment to grow the economy while protecting the environment that s what i d like them to know about me that i ve gotten up every day and worked for the american people and worked so that their children could have their dreams come true and i believe we ve got the results to show we re on the right track the most important thing is i believe we ve got the right ideas for the future and like senator dole i like senator dole you can probably tell we like each other we just see the world in different ways and you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right senator dole well i d say you know the first homeless bill in the senate was the dole byrd bill part of the byrd dole bill i can t remember who was in control then i remember working with senator ribicoff from connecticut on the hospice program we now have 2 500 hospices as i said i remember i ve worked all my life while i was in the congress i left on june 11 because i wanted the american people to know that i was willing to give up something president clinton ran for governor in 1990 and said he was going to fill out his term but he didn t he s president so i guess it s a little better deal but i wanted the american people to know that i was willing to give up something it wasn t just getting more power and more power so i rolled the dice i put my career on the line because i really believe the future of america is on the line we can give you all these numbers they don t mean a thing if you re out of work you have nothing to eat or you can t have medical care or you re holding a crack baby in your arms right now and what do you do next you know america s best days are ahead of us i ve seen the tough times i know they can be better and i ll lead america to a brighter future lehrer mr president what do you say to senator dole s point that this election is about keeping one s word president clinton let s look at that when i ran for president i said we d cut the deficit in half in four years we ve cut it by 60 percent i said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs we have 10 million new jobs we re number one in autos again record numbers of new small businesses i said we d pass a crime bill that would put 100 000 police on the street ban assault weapons and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment including capital punishment for drug kingpins and we did that i said we would change the way welfare works and even before the bill passed we had moved nearly two million people from welfare to work working with states and communities i said we d get tougher on child support and child support enforcement is up 50 percent i said that i would work for tax relief for middle class americans the deficit was bigger than i thought it was going to be and i think they re better off all of us are that we got those interest rates down and the deficit down the republicans talk about it but we re the first administration in anybody s lifetime looking at this program to bring that deficit down four years in a row we still gave tax cuts to 15 million working americans and now i ve got a plan that has been out there for two years it could have been passed already but instead the republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me and i couldn t take that but we ll get the rest of that tax relief and so i think when you can look at those results you know that the plan i have laid out for the future has a very good chance of being enacted if you ll give me a chance to build that bridge to the 21st century lehrer senator senator dole well there he goes again i mean it s a line that has been used before but exaggerating all of the things he did he didn t do all these things let s take all of these 4 you know years in a row he came in with a high growth rate the 1990 budget agreement which some didn t like had some very tough cost controls it put a lot of pressure on congress the s l crisis was over they were starting to sell assets all of that money was coming in and he cut defense an extra 60 billion threw a lot of people out of work he talks about a smaller government there are actually more people in government except for the people in defense related jobs they re gone the government is bigger than it was when president kennedy was around even though he says it s not in addition the republican congress cut 53 billion so let s give credit where credit is due governor engler in michigan cut taxes 21 times created a lot of new jobs so did governor thompson so did governor rowland and a lot of people out there deserve credit mr president when i m president of the united states we re going to have a governors council and we re going to work directly with the governors republicans and democrats to the get power back to people and back to the states president clinton i think a lot of people deserve credit and i ve tried to give it to them but i believe that my plan is better than senator dole s ill advised 550 billion scheme which i will say again will blow a hole in the deficit our plan will balance the budget and grow the economy preserve the environment and invest in education we have the right approach for the future and look at the results it is not midnight in america senator we are better off than we were four years ago lehrer all right that s the last question the last answer let s go now to the closing statements senator dole are we done lehrer mr president you re first two minutes president clinton well first jim let me thank you and thank you senator dole and thank you ladies and gentlemen all of you listening tonight for the chance you ve given us to appear i want to say in the beginning that i am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years i never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life and i ve done my best to be faithful to the charge you ve given me i m proud of the fact that america is stronger and more prosperous and more secure than we were four years ago i m glad we re going in the right direction and i ve done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century i d like to leave you with the thought that the things i do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives i have seen affected by what does or doesn t happen in this country the autoworker in toledo who was unemployed when i was elected and now has a great job because we re number one in auto production again all the people i ve met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children and i think what others could do for our country and for themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way i think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job because of the family and medical leave act i think of all the people that i grew up with and went to school with whom i stay in touch with and who never let me forget how what we do in washington affects all of you out there in america folks we can build that bridge to the 21st century big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across and i hope that you will help me build it lehrer senator dole your closing statement sir senator dole thank you jim thank you mr president thank everyone for watching and listening i want to address my remarks to the young people of america because they re the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st century they re the ones who have the challenges and there are people out there making predictions that it s not going to be the same you re not going to have the opportunity there is going to be more deficits more drugs more crime and less confidence in the american people and that s what you re faced with what the parents are faced with and the grandparents are faced with it s important it s their future and i would say to those i know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before drug use has gone up and if you care about the future of america if you care about your future just don t do it and i know that i am someone older than you but i ve had my anxious moments in my life i ve learned to feed myself and to walk and to dress i m standing here as proof that in america the possibilities are unlimited i know who i am and i know where i m from and i know where i want to take america we are the greatest country on the face of the earth we do more good things for more people in our communities our neighborhoods than anywhere that i know of this is important business this election is important i ask for your support i ask for your help if you really want to get involved just tap into my home page www dolekemp96 org thank you god bless

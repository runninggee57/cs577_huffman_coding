good evening last week the warring factions in bosnia reached a peace agreement as a result of our efforts in dayton ohio and the support of our european and russian partners tonight i want to speak with you about implementing the bosnian peace agreement and why our values and interests as americans require that we participate let me say at the outset america s role will not be about fighting a war it will be about helping the people of bosnia to secure their own peace agreement our mission will be limited focused and under the command of an american general in fulfilling this mission we will have the chance to help stop the killing of innocent civilians especially children and at the same time to bring stability to central europe a region of the world that is vital to our national interests it is the right thing to do from our birth america has always been more than just a place america has embodied an idea that has become the ideal for billions of people throughout the world our founders said it best america is about life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in this century especially america has done more than simply stand for these ideals we have acted on them and sacrificed for them our people fought two world wars so that freedom could triumph over tyranny after world war i we pulled back from the world leaving a vacuum that was filled by the forces of hatred after world war ii we continued to lead the world we made the commitments that kept the peace that helped to spread democracy that created unparalleled prosperity and that brought victory in the cold war today because of our dedication america s ideals liberty democracy and peace are more and more the aspirations of people everywhere in the world it is the power of our ideas even more than our size our wealth and our military might that makes america a uniquely trusted nation with the cold war over some people now question the need for our continued active leadership in the world they believe that much like after world war i america can now step back from the responsibilities of leadership they argue that to be secure we need only to keep our own borders safe and that the time has come now to leave to others the hard work of leadership beyond our borders i strongly disagree as the cold war gives way to the global village our leadership is needed more than ever because problems that start beyond our borders can quickly become problems within them we re all vulnerable to the organized forces of intolerance and destruction terrorism ethnic religious and regional rivalries the spread of organized crime and weapons of mass destruction and drug trafficking just as surely as fascism and communism these forces also threaten freedom and democracy peace and prosperity and they too demand american leadership but nowhere has the argument for our leadership been more clearly justified than in the struggle to stop or prevent war and civil violence from iraq to haiti from south africa to korea from the middle east to northern ireland we have stood up for peace and freedom because it s in our interest to do so and because it is the right thing to do now that doesn t mean we can solve every problem my duty as president is to match the demands for american leadership to our strategic interest and to our ability to make a difference america cannot and must not be the world s policeman we cannot stop all war for all time but we can stop some wars we cannot save all women and all children but we can save many of them we can t do everything but we must do what we can there are times and places where our leadership can mean the difference between peace and war and where we can defend our fundamental values as a people and serve our most basic strategic interests my fellow americans in this new era there are still times when america and america alone can and should make the difference for peace the terrible war in bosnia is such a case nowhere today is the need for american leadership more stark or more immediate than in bosnia for nearly 4 years a terrible war has torn bosnia apart horrors we prayed had been banished from europe forever have been seared into our minds again skeletal prisoners caged behind barbed wire fences women and girls raped as a tool of war defenseless men and boys shot down into mass graves evoking visions of world war ii concentration camps and endless lines of refugees marching toward a future of despair when i took office some were urging immediate intervention in the conflict i decided that american ground troops should not fight a war in bosnia because the united states could not force peace on bosnia s warring ethnic groups the serbs croats and muslims instead america has worked with our european allies in searching for peace stopping the war from spreading and easing the suffering of the bosnian people we imposed tough economic sanctions on serbia we used our air power to conduct the longest humanitarian airlift in history and to enforce a no fly zone that took the war out of the skies we helped to make peace between two of the three warring parties the muslims and the croats but as the months of war turned into years it became clear that europe alone could not end the conflict this summer bosnian serb shelling once again turned bosnia s playgrounds and marketplaces into killing fields in response the united states led nato s heavy and continuous air strikes many of them flown by skilled and brave american pilots those air strikes together with the renewed determination of our european partners and the bosnian and croat gains on the battlefield convinced the serbs finally to start thinking about making peace at the same time the united states initiated an intensive diplomatic effort that forged a bosnia wide cease fire and got the parties to agree to the basic principles of peace three dedicated american diplomats bob frasure joe kruzel and nelson drew lost their lives in that effort tonight we remember their sacrifice and that of their families and we will never forget their exceptional service to our nation finally just 3 weeks ago the muslims croats and serbs came to dayton ohio in america s heartland to negotiate a settlement there exhausted by war they made a commitment to peace they agreed to put down their guns to preserve bosnia as a single state to investigate and prosecute war criminals to protect the human rights of all citizens to try to build a peaceful democratic future and they asked for america s help as they implement this peace agreement america has a responsibility to answer that request to help to turn this moment of hope into an enduring reality to do that troops from our country and around the world would go into bosnia to give them the confidence and support they need to implement their peace plan i refuse to send american troops to fight a war in bosnia but i believe we must help to secure the bosnian peace i want you to know tonight what is at stake exactly what our troops will be asked to accomplish and why we must carry out our responsibility to help implement the peace agreement implementing the agreement in bosnia can end the terrible suffering of the people the warfare the mass executions the ethnic cleansing the campaigns of rape and terror let us never forget a quarter of a million men women and children have been shelled shot and tortured to death two million people half of the population were forced from their homes and into a miserable life as refugees and these faceless numbers hide millions of real personal tragedies for each of the war s victims was a mother or daughter a father or son a brother or sister now the war is over american leadership created the chance to build a peace and stop the suffering securing peace in bosnia will also help to build a free and stable europe bosnia lies at the very heart of europe next door to many of its fragile new democracies and some of our closest allies generations of americans have understood that europe s freedom and europe s stability is vital to our own national security that s why we fought two wars in europe that s why we launched the marshall plan to restore europe that s why we created nato and waged the cold war and that s why we must help the nations of europe to end their worst nightmare since world war ii now the only force capable of getting this job done is nato the powerful military alliance of democracies that has guaranteed our security for half a century now and as nato s leader and the primary broker of the peace agreement the united states must be an essential part of the mission if we re not there nato will not be there the peace will collapse the war will reignite the slaughter of innocents will begin again a conflict that already has claimed so many victims could spread like poison throughout the region eat away at europe s stability and erode our partnership with our european allies and america s commitment to leadership will be questioned if we refuse to participate in implementing a peace agreement we brokered right here in the united states especially since the presidents of bosnia croatia and serbia all asked us to participate and all pledged their best efforts to the security of our troops when america s partnerships are weak and our leadership is in doubt it undermines our ability to secure our interests and to convince others to work with us if we do maintain our partnerships and our leadership we need not act alone as we saw in the gulf war and in haiti many other nations who share our goals will also share our burdens but when america does not lead the consequences can be very grave not only for others but eventually for us as well as i speak to you nato is completing its planning for ifor an international force for peace in bosnia of about 60 000 troops already more than 25 other nations including our major nato allies have pledged to take part they will contribute about two thirds of the total implementation force some 40 000 troops the united states would contribute the rest about 20 000 soldiers later this week the final nato plan will be submitted to me for review and approval let me make clear what i expect it to include and what it must include for me to give final approval to the participation of our armed forces first the mission will be precisely defined with clear realistic goals that can be achieved in a definite period of time our troops will make sure that each side withdraws its forces behind the frontlines and keeps them there they will maintain the cease fire to prevent the war from accidentally starting again these efforts in turn will help to create a secure environment so that the people of bosnia can return to their homes vote in free elections and begin to rebuild their lives our joint chiefs of staff have concluded that this mission should and will take about one year second the risks to our troops will be minimized american troops will take their orders from the american general who commands nato they will be heavily armed and thoroughly trained by making an overwhelming show of force they will lessen the need to use force but unlike the u n forces they will have the authority to respond immediately and the training and the equipment to respond with overwhelming force to any threat to their own safety or any violations of the military provisions of the peace agreement if the nato plan meets with my approval i will immediately send it to congress and request its support i will also authorize the participation of a small number of american troops in a nato advance mission that will lay the groundwork for ifor starting sometime next week they will establish headquarters and set up the sophisticated communication systems that must be in place before nato can send in its troops tanks and trucks to bosnia the implementation force itself would begin deploying in bosnia in the days following the formal signature of the peace agreement in mid december the international community will help to implement arms control provisions of the agreement so that future hostilities are less likely and armaments are limited while the world community the united states and others will also make sure that the bosnian federation has the means to defend itself once ifor withdraws ifor will not be a part of this effort civilian agencies from around the world will begin a separate program of humanitarian relief and reconstruction principally paid for by our european allies and other interested countries this effort is also absolutely essential to making the peace endure it will bring the people of bosnia the food shelter clothing and medicine so many have been denied for so long it will help them to rebuild to rebuild their roads and schools their power plants and hospitals their factories and shops it will reunite children with their parents and families with their homes it will allow the bosnians freely to choose their own leaders it will give all the people of bosnia a much greater stake in peace than war so that peace takes on a life and a logic of its own in bosnia we can and will succeed because our mission is clear and limited and our troops are strong and very well prepared but my fellow americans no deployment of american troops is risk free and this one may well involve casualties there may be accidents in the field or incidents with people who have not given up their hatred i will take every measure possible to minimize these risks but we must be prepared for that possibility as president my most difficult duty is to put the men and women who volunteer to serve our nation in harm s way when our interests and values demand it i assume full responsibility for any harm that may come to them but anyone contemplating any action that would endanger our troops should know this america protects its own anyone anyone who takes on our troops will suffer the consequences we will fight fire with fire and then some after so much bloodshed and loss after so many outrageous acts of inhuman brutality it will take an extraordinary effort of will for the people of bosnia to pull themselves from their past and start building a future of peace but with our leadership and the commitment of our allies the people of bosnia can have the chance to decide their future in peace they have a chance to remind the world that just a few short years ago the mosques and churches of sarajevo were a shining symbol of multiethnic tolerance that bosnia once found unity in its diversity indeed the cemetery in the center of the city was just a few short years ago a magnificent stadium which hosted the olympics our universal symbol of peace and harmony bosnia can be that kind of place again we must not turn our backs on bosnia now and so i ask all americans and i ask every member of congress democrat and republican alike to make the choice for peace in the choice between peace and war america must choose peace my fellow americans i ask you to think just for a moment about this century that is drawing to close and the new one that will soon begin because previous generations of americans stood up for freedom and because we continue to do so the american people are more secure and more prosperous and all around the world more people than ever before live in freedom more people than ever before are treated with dignity more people than ever before can hope to build a better life that is what america s leadership is all about we know that these are the blessings of freedom and america has always been freedom s greatest champion if we continue to do everything we can to share these blessings with people around the world if we continue to be leaders for peace then the next century can be the greatest time our nation has ever known a few weeks ago i was privileged to spend some time with his holiness pope john paul ii when he came to america at the very end of our meeting the pope looked at me and said i have lived through most of this century i remember that it began with a war in sarajevo mr president you must not let it end with a war in sarajevo in bosnia this terrible war has challenged our interests and troubled our souls thankfully we can do something about it i say again our mission will be clear limited and achievable the people of bosnia our nato allies and people all around the world are now looking to america for leadership so let us lead that is our responsibility as americans goodnight and god bless america

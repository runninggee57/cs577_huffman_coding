my fellow americans tonight for the first time in 79 days the skies over yugoslavia are silent the serb army and police are withdrawing from kosovo the one million men women and children driven from their land are preparing to return home the demands of an outraged and united international community have been met i can report to the american people that we have achieved a victory for a safer world for our democratic values and for a stronger america our pilots have returned to base the airstrikes have been suspended aggression against an innocent people has been contained and is being turned back when i ordered our armed forces into combat we had three clear goals to enable the kosovar people the victims of some of the most vicious atrocities in europe since the second world war to return to their homes with safety and self government to require serbian forces responsible for those atrocities to leave kosovo and to deploy an international security force with nato at its core to protect all the people of that troubled land serbs and albanians alike those goals will be achieved a necessary conflict has been brought to a just and honorable conclusion the result will be security and dignity for the people of kosovo achieved by an alliance that stood together in purpose and resolve assisted by the diplomatic efforts of russia this victory brings a new hope that when a people are singled out for destruction because of their heritage and religious faith and we can do something about it the world will not look the other way i want to express my profound gratitude to the men and women of our armed forces and those of our allies day after day night after night they flew risking their lives to attack their targets and to avoid civilian casualties when they were fired upon from populated areas i ask every american to join me in saying to them thank you you ve made us very proud i m also grateful to the american people for standing against the awful ethnic cleansing for sending generous assistance to the refugees and for opening your hearts and your homes to the innocent victims who came here i want to speak with you for a few moments tonight about why we fought what we achieved and what we have to do now to advance the peace and together with the people of the balkans forge a future of freedom progress and harmony we should remember that the violence we responded to in kosovo was the culmination of a 10 year campaign by slobodan milosevic the leader of serbia to exploit ethnic and religious differences in order to impose his will on the lands of the former yugoslavia that s what he tried to do in croatia and in bosnia and now in kosovo the world saw the terrifying consequences 500 villages burned men of all ages separated from their loved ones to be shot and buried in mass graves women raped children made to watch their parents die a whole people forced to abandon in hours communities their families had spent generations building for these atrocities mr milosevic and his top aides have been indicted by the international war crimes tribunal for war crimes and crimes against humanity i will never forget the kosovar refugees i recently met some of them could barely talk about what they had been through all they had left was hope that the world would not turn its back when our diplomatic efforts to avert this horror were rebuffed and the violence mounted we and our allies chose to act mr milosevic continued to do terrible things to the people of kosovo but we were determined to turn him back our firmness finally has brought an end to a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing and we acted early enough to reverse it to enable the kosovars to go home when they do they will be safe they will be able to reopen their schools speak their language practice their religion choose their leaders and shape their destiny there ll be no more days of foraging for food in the cold of mountains and forests no more nights of hiding in cellars wondering if the next day will bring death or deliverance they will know that mr milosevic s army and paramilitary forces will be gone his 10 year campaign of repression finished nato has achieved this success as a united alliance ably led by secretary general solana and general clark nineteen democracies came together and stayed together through the stiffest military challenge in nato s 50 year history we also preserved our critically important partnership with russia thanks to president yeltsin who opposed our military effort but supported diplomacy to end the conflict on terms that met our conditions i m grateful to russian envoy chernomyrdin and finnish president ahtisaari for their work and to vice president gore for the key role he played in putting their partnership together now i hope russian troops will join us in the force that will keep the peace in kosovo just as they have in bosnia finally we have averted the wider war this conflict might well have sparked the countries of southeastern europe backed the nato campaign helped the refugees and showed the world there is more compassion than cruelty in this troubled region this victory makes it all the more likely that they will choose a future of democracy fair treatment of minorities and peace now we re entering a new phase building that peace and there are formidable challenges first we must be sure the serbian authorities meet their commitments we are prepared to resume our military campaign should they fail to do so next we must get the kosovar refugees home safely mine fields will have to be cleared homes destroyed by serb forces will have to be rebuilt homeless people in need of food and medicine will have to get them the fate of the missing will have to be determined the kosovar liberation army will have to demilitarize as it has agreed to do and we in the peacekeeping force will have to ensure that kosovo is a safe place to live for all its citizens ethnic serbs as well as ethnic albanians for these things to happen security must be established to that end some 50 000 troops from almost 30 countries will deploy to kosovo our european allies will provide the vast majority of them america will contribute about 7 000 we are grateful that during nato s air campaign we did not lose a single serviceman in combat but this next phase also will be dangerous bitter memories will still be fresh and there may well be casualties so we have made sure that the force going into kosovo will have nato command and control and rules of engagement set by nato it will have the means and the mandate to protect itself while doing its job in the meantime the united nations will organize a civilian administration while preparing the kosovars to govern and police themselves as local institutions take hold nato will be able to turn over increasing responsibility to them and draw down its forces a third challenge will be to put in place a plan for lasting peace and stability in kosovo and through all the balkans for that to happen the european union and the united states must plan for tomorrow not just today we must help to give the democracies of southeastern europe a path to a prosperous shared future a unifying magnet more powerful than the pull of hatred and destruction that has threatened to tear them apart our european partners must provide most of the resources for this effort but it is in america s interest to do our part as well a final challenge will be to encourage serbia to join its neighbors in this historic journey to a peaceful democratic united europe i want to say a few words to the serbian people tonight i know that you too have suffered in mr milosevic s wars you should know that your leaders could have kept kosovo as a part of your country without driving a single kosovar family from its home without killing a single adult or child without inviting a single nato bomb to fall on your country you endured 79 days of bombing not to keep kosovo a province of serbia but simply because mr milosevic was determined to eliminate kosovar albanians from kosovo dead or alive as long as he remains in power as long as your nation is ruled by an indicted war criminal we will provide no support for the reconstruction of serbia but we are ready to provide humanitarian aid now and to help to build a better future for serbia too when its government represents tolerance and freedom not repression and terror my fellow americans all these challenges are substantial but they are far preferable to the challenges of war and continued instability in europe we have sent a message of determination and hope to all the world think of all the millions of innocent people who died in this bloody century because democracies reacted too late to evil and aggression because of our resolve the 20th century is ending not with helpless indignation but with a hopeful affirmation of human dignity and human rights for the 21st century in a world too divided by fear among people of different racial ethnic and religious groups we have given confidence to the friends of freedom and pause to those who would exploit human difference for inhuman purposes america still faces great challenges in this world but we look forward to meeting them so tonight i ask you to be proud of your country and very proud of the men and women who serve it in uniform for in kosovo we did the right thing we did it the right way and we will finish the job good night and may god bless our wonderful united states of america

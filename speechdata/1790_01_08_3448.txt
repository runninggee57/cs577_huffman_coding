oppression and the necessary exercise of lawful authority between burthens proceeding from a disregard to their convenience and those resulting from the inevitable exigencies of society to discriminate the spirit of liberty from that of licentiousness cherishing the first avoiding the last and uniting a speedy but temperate vigilance against encroachments with an inviolable respect to the laws whether this desirable object will be the best promoted by affording aids to seminaries of learning already established by the institution of a national university or by any other expedients

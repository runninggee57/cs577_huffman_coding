the period for a new election of a citizen to administer the executive government of the united states being not far distant and the time actually arrived when your thoughts must be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with that important trust it appears to me proper especially as it may conduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice that i should now apprise you of the resolution i have formed to decline being considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to be made i beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured that this resolution has not been taken without a strict regard to all the considerations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful citizen to his country and that in withdrawing the tender of service which silence in my situation might imply i am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future interest no deficiency of grateful respect for your past kindness but am supported by a full conviction that the step is compatible with both the acceptance of and continuance hitherto in the office to which your suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty and to a deference for what appeared to be your desire i constantly hoped that it would have been much earlier in my power consistently with motives which i was not at liberty to disregard to return to that retirement from which i had been reluctantly drawn the strength of my inclination to do this previous to the last election had even led to the preparation of an address to declare it to you but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations and the unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence impelled me to abandon the idea i rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as internal no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible with the sentiment of duty or propriety and am persuaded whatever partiality may be retained for my services that in the present circumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination to retire the impressions with which i first undertook the arduous trust were explained on the proper occasion in the discharge of this trust i will only say that i have with good intentions contributed toward the organization and administration of the government the best exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable not unconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications experience in my own eyes perhaps still more in the eyes of others has strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself and every day the increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the shade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome satisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my services they were temporary i have the consolation to believe that while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene patriotism does not forbid it in looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the career of my political life my feelings do not permit me to suspend the deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which i owe to my beloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me still more for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and for the opportunities i have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering though in usefulness unequal to my zeal if benefits have resulted to our country from these services let it always be remembered to your praise and as an instructive example in our annals that under circumstances in which the passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead amidst appearances sometimes dubious vicissitudes of fortune often discouraging in situations in which not unfrequently want of success has countenanced the spirit of criticism the constancy of your support was the essential prop of the efforts and a guaranty of the plans by which they were effected profoundly penetrated with this idea i shall carry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows that heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual that the free constitution which is the work of your hands may be sacredly maintained that its administration in every department may be stamped with wisdom and virtue that in fine the happiness of the people of these states under the auspices of liberty may be made complete by so careful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause the affection and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it here perhaps i ought to stop but a solicitude for your welfare which can not end but with my life and the apprehension of danger natural to that solicitude urge me on an occasion like the present to offer to your solemn contemplation and to recommend to your frequent review some sentiments which are the result of much reflection of no inconsiderable observation and which appear to me all important to the permanency of your felicity as a people these will be offered to you with the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested warnings of a parting friend who can possibly have no personal motive to bias his counsel nor can i forget as an encouragement to it your indulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar occasion interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm the attachment the unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now dear to you it is justly so for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence the support of your tranquillity at home your peace abroad of your safety of your prosperity of that very liberty which you so highly prize but as it is easy to foresee that from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken many artifices employed to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth as this is the point in your political fortress against which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and actively though often covertly and insidiously directed it is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and individual happiness that you should cherish a cordial habitual and immovable attachment to it accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts for this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest citizens by birth or choice of a common country that country has a right to concentrate your affections the name of american which belongs to you in your national capacity must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derived from local discriminations with slight shades of difference you have the same religion manners habits and political principles you have in a common cause fought and triumphed together the independence and liberty you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts of common dangers sufferings and successes but these considerations however powerfully they address themselves to your sensibility are greatly outweighed by those which apply more immediately to your interest here every portion of our country finds the most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the union of the whole the north in an unrestrained intercourse with the south protected by the equal laws of a common government finds in the productions of the latter great additional resources of maritime and commercial enterprise and precious materials of manufacturing industry the south in the same intercourse benefiting by the same agency of the north sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand turning partly into its own channels the seamen of the north it finds its particular navigation invigorated and while it contributes in different ways to nourish and increase the general mass of the national navigation it looks forward to the protection of a maritime strength to which itself is unequally adapted the east in a like intercourse with the west already finds and in the progressive improvement of interior communications by land and water will more and more find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad or manufactures at home the west derives from the east supplies requisite to its growth and comfort and what is perhaps of still greater consequence it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight influence and the future maritime strength of the atlantic side of the union directed by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation any other tenure by which the west can hold this essential advantage whether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any foreign power must be intrinsically precarious while then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and particular interest in union all the parts combined can not fail to find in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength greater resource proportionably greater security from external danger a less frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations and what is of inestimable value they must derive from union an exemption from those broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict neighboring countries not tied together by the same governments which their own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce but which opposite foreign alliances attachments and intrigues would stimulate and imbitter hence likewise they will avoid the necessity of those overgrown military establishments which under any form of government are inauspicious to liberty and which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty in this sense it is that your union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the other these considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting and virtuous mind and exhibit the continuance of the union as a primary object of patriotic desire is there a doubt whether a common government can embrace so large a sphere let experience solve it to listen to mere speculation in such a case were criminal we are authorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole with the auxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions will afford a happy issue to the experiment it is well worth a fair and full experiment with such powerful and obvious motives to union affecting all parts of our country while experience shall not have demonstrated its impracticability there will always be reason to distrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its bands in contemplating the causes which may disturb our union it occurs as matter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished for characterizing parties by geographical discriminations northern and southern atlantic and western whence designing men may endeavor to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests and views one of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts you can not shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection the inhabitants of our western country have lately had a useful lesson on this head they have seen in the negotiation by the executive and in the unanimous ratification by the senate of the treaty with spain and in the universal satisfaction at that event throughout the united states a decisive proof how unfounded were the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general government and in the atlantic states unfriendly to their interests in regard to the mississippi they have been witnesses to the formation of two treaties that with great britain and that with spain which secure to them everything they could desire in respect to our foreign relations toward confirming their prosperity will it not be their wisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the union by which they were procured will they not henceforth be deaf to those advisers if such there are who would sever them from their brethren and connect them with aliens to the efficacy and permanency of your union a government for the whole is indispensable no alliances however strict between the parts can be an adequate substitute they must inevitably experience the infractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have experienced sensible of this momentous truth you have improved upon your first essay by the adoption of a constitution of government better calculated than your former for an intimate union and for the efficacious management of your common concerns this government the offspring of our own choice uninfluenced and unawed adopted upon full investigation and mature deliberation completely free in its principles in the distribution of its powers uniting security with energy and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment has a just claim to your confidence and your support respect for its authority compliance with its laws acquiescence in its measures are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty the basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government but the constitution which at any time exists till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly obligatory upon all the very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established government all obstructions to the execution of the laws all combinations and associations under whatever plausible character with the real design to direct control counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities are destructive of this fundamental principle and of fatal tendency they serve to organize faction to give it an artificial and extraordinary force to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community and according to the alternate triumphs of different parties to snake the public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous projects of faction rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common counsels and modified by mutual interests however combinations or associations of the above description may now and then answer popular ends they are likely in the course of time and things to become potent engines by which cunning ambitious and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion toward the preservation of your government and the permanency of your present happy state it is requisite not only that you steadily discountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority but also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles however specious the pretexts one method of assault may be to effect in the forms of the constitution alterations which will impair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what can not be directly overthrown in all the changes to which you may be invited remember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of governments as of other human institutions that experience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of the existing constitution of a country that facility in changes upon the credit of mere hypothesis and opinion exposes to perpetual change from the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion and remember especially that for the efficient management of your common interests in a country so extensive as ours a government of as much vigor as is consistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable liberty itself will find in such a government with powers properly distributed and adjusted its surest guardian it is indeed little else than a name where the government is too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction to confine each member of the society within the limits prescribed by the laws and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property i have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally this spirit unfortunately is inseparable from our nature having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind it exists under different shapes in all governments more or less stifled controlled or repressed but in those of the popular form it is seen in its greatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy the alternate domination of one faction over another sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities is itself a frightful despotism but this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism the disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction more able or more fortunate than his competitors turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty without looking forward to an extremity of this kind which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it it serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration it agitates the community with ill rounded jealousies and false alarms kindles the animosity of one part against another foments occasionally riot and insurrection it opens the door to foreign influence and corruption which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passion thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another there is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks upon the administration of the government and serve to keep alive the spirit of liberty this within certain limits is probably true and in governments of a monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence if not with favor upon the spirit of party but in those of the popular character in governments purely elective it is a spirit not to be encouraged from their natural tendency it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose and there being constant danger of excess the effort ought to be by force of public opinion to mitigate and assuage it a fire not to be quenched it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame lest instead of warming it should consume it is important likewise that the habits of thinking in a free country should inspire caution in those intrusted with its administration to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another the spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one and thus to create whatever the form of government a real despotism a just estimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position the necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power by dividing and distributing it into different depositories and constituting each the guardian of the public weal against invasions by the others has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern some of them in our country and under our own eyes to preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them if in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the constitution designates but let there be no change by usurpation for though this in one instance may be the instrument of good it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed the precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity religion and morality are indispensable supports in vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens the mere politician equally with the pious man ought to respect and to cherish them a volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity let it simply be asked where is the security for property for reputation for life if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle it is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government the rule indeed extends with more or less force to every species of free government who that is a sincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the fabric promote then as an object of primary importance institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge in proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public opinion it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened as a very important source of strength and security cherish public credit one method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as possible avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace but remembering also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger frequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it avoiding likewise the accumulation of debt not only by shunning occasions of expense but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the debts which unavoidable wars have occasioned not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burthen which we ourselves ought to bear the execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives but it is necessary that public opinion should cooperate to facilitate to them the performance of their duty it is essential that you should practically bear in mind that toward the payment of debts there must be revenue that to have revenue there must be taxes that no taxes can be devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant that thee intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the proper objects which is always a choice of difficulties ought to be a decisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the government in making it and for a spirit of acquiescence in the measures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any time dictate observe good faith and justice toward all nations cultivate peace and harmony with all religion and morality enjoin this conduct and can it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it it will be worthy of a free enlightened and at no distant period a great nation to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence who can doubt that in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan would richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a steady adherence to it can it be that providence has not connected the permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue the experiment at least is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature alas is it rendered impossible by its vices in the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that permanent inveterate antipathies against particular nations and passionate attachments for others should be excluded and that in place of them just and amicable feelings toward all should be cultivated the nation which indulges toward another an habitual hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave it is a slave to its animosity or to its affection either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest antipathy in one nation against another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage and to be haughty and intractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur hence frequent collisions obstinate envenomed and bloody contests the nation prompted by ill will and resentment sometimes impels to war the government contrary to the best calculations of policy the government sometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts through passion what reason would reject at other times it makes the animosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated by pride ambition and other sinister and pernicious motives the peace often sometimes perhaps the liberty of nations has been the victim so likewise a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils sympathy for the favorite nation facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities of the other betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification it leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained and by exciting jealousy ill will and a disposition to retaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld and it gives to ambitions corrupted or deluded citizens who devote themselves to the favorite nation facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country without odium sometimes even with popularity gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation a commendable deference for public opinion or a laudable zeal for public good the base or foolish compliances of ambition corruption or infatuation as avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways such attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot how many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic factions to practice the arts of seduction to mislead public opinion to influence or awe the public councils such an attachment of a small or weak toward a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the satellite of the latter against the insidious wiles of foreign influence i conjure you to believe me fellow citizens the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government but that jealousy to be useful must be impartial else it becomes the instrument of the very influence to be avoided instead of a defense against it excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on the other real patriots who may resist the intrigues of the favorite are liable to become suspected and odious while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their interests the great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations to have with them as little political connection as possible so far as we have already formed engagements let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith here let us stop europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none or a very remote relation hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course if we remain one people under an efficient government the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected when belligerent nations under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation when we may choose peace or war as our interest guided by justice shall counsel why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground why by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of europe entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of european ambition rivalship interest humor or caprice it is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world so far i mean as we are now at liberty to do it for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements i hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs that honesty is always the best policy i repeat therefore let those engagements be unwise to extend them taking care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments on a respectable defensive posture we may safely trust to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies harmony liberal intercourse with all nations are recommended by policy humanity and interest but even our commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences consulting the natural course of things diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of commerce but forcing nothing establishing with powers so disposed in order to give trade a stable course to define the rights of our merchants and to enable the government to support them conventional rules of intercourse the best that present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit but temporary and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as experience and circumstances shall dictate constantly keeping in view that it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from another that it must pay with a portion of its independence for whatever it may accept under that character that by such acceptance it may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for nominal favors and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not giving more there can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation it is an illusion which experience must cure which a just pride ought to discard in offering to you my countrymen these counsels of an old and affectionate friend i dare not hope they will make the strong and lasting impression i could wish that they will control the usual current of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course which has hitherto marked the destiny of nations but if i may even flatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit some occasional good that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party spirit to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism this hope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by which they have been dictated how far in the discharge of my official duties i have been guided by the principles which have been delineated the public records and other evidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world to myself the assurance of my own conscience is that i have at least believed myself to be guided by them in relation to the still subsisting war in europe my proclamation of the 22d of april 1793 is the index to my plan sanctioned by your approving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of congress the spirit of that measure has continually governed me uninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it after deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights i could obtain i was well satisfied that our country under all the circumstances of the case had a right to take and was bound in duty and interest to take a neutral position having taken it i determined as far as should depend upon me to maintain it with moderation perseverance and firmness the considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is not necessary on this occasion to detail i will only observe that according to my understanding of the matter that right so far from being denied by any of the belligerent powers has been virtually admitted by all the duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred without anything more from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on every nation in cases in which it is free to act to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity toward other nations the inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be referred to your own reflections and experience with me a predominant motive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and mature its yet recent institutions and to progress without interruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is necessary to give it humanly speaking the command of its own fortunes though in reviewing the incidents of my administration i am unconscious of intentional error i am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that i may have committed many errors whatever they may be i fervently beseech the almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend i shall also carry with me the hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence and that after forty five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest relying on its kindness in this as in other things and actuated by that fervent love toward it which is so natural to a man who views in it the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several generations i anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which i promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of partaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of good laws under a free government the ever favorite object of my heart and the happy reward as i trust of our mutual cares labors and dangers

mr president mr speaker members of the 96th congress and my fellow citizens tonight i want to examine in a broad sense the state of our american union how we are building a new foundation for a peaceful and a prosperous world our children who will be born this year will come of age in the 21st century what kind of society what kind of world are we building for them will we ourselves be at peace will our children enjoy a better quality of life will a strong and united america still be a force for freedom and prosperity around the world tonight there is every sign that the state of our union is sound our economy offers greater prosperity for more of our people than ever before real per capita income and real business profits have risen substantially in the last two years farm exports are setting an all time record each year and farm income last year net farm income was up more than 25 percent our liberties are secure our military defenses are strong and growing stronger and more importantly tonight america our beloved country is at peace our earliest national commitments modified and reshaped by succeeding generations have served us well but the problems that we face today are different from those that confronted earlier generations of americans they are more subtle more complex and more interrelated at home we are recognizing ever more clearly that government alone cannot solve these problems and abroad few of them can be solved by the united states alone but americans as a united people working with our allies and friends have never been afraid to face problems and to solve problems either here or abroad the challenge to us is to build a new and firmer foundation for the future for a sound economy for a more effective government for more political trust and for a stable peace so that the america our children inherit will be even stronger and even better than it is today we cannot resort to simplistic or extreme solutions which substitute myths for common sense in our economy it is a myth that we must choose endlessly between inflation and recession together we build the foundation for a strong economy with lower inflation without contriving either a recession with its high unemployment or unworkable mandatory government controls in our government it is a myth that we must choose between compassion and competence together we build the foundation for a government that works and works for people in our relations with our potential adversaries it is a myth that we must choose between confrontation and capitulation together we build the foundation for a stable world of both diversity and peace together we ve already begun to build the foundation for confidence in our economic system during the last two years in bringing our economy out of the deepest recession since the 1930s we ve created 7 100 000 new jobs the unemployment rate has gone down 25 percent and now we must redouble our fight against the persistent inflation that has wracked our country for more than a decade that s our important domestic issue and we must do it together we know that inflation is a burden for all americans but it s a disaster for the poor the sick and the old no american family should be forced to choose among food warmth health care or decent housing because the cost of any of these basic necessities has climbed out of reach three months ago i outlined to the nation a balanced anti inflation program that couples responsible government restraint with responsible wage and price restraint it s based upon my knowledge that there is a more powerful force than government compulsion the force created by the cooperative efforts of millions of americans working toward a common goal business and labor have been increasingly supportive it s imperative that we in government do our part we must stop excessive government growth and we must control government spending habits i ve sent to this congress a stringent but a fair budget one that since i ran for president in 1976 will have cut the federal deficit in half and as a percentage of our gross national product the deficit will have dropped by almost 75 percent this congress had a good record last year and i now ask the 96th congress to continue this partnership in holding the line on excess federal spending it will not be easy but we must be strong and we must be persistent this budget is a clear message that with the help of you and the american people i am determined as president to bring inflation under control the 1980 budget provides enough spending restraint to begin unwinding inflation but enough support for our country to keep american workers productive and to encourage the investments that provide new jobs we will continue to mobilize our nation s resources to reduce our trade deficit substantially this year and to maintain the strength of the american dollar we ve demonstrated in this restrained budget that we can build on the gains of the past two years to provide additional support to educate disadvantaged children to care for the elderly to provide nutrition and legal services for the poor and to strengthen the economic base of our urban communities and also our rural areas this year we will take our first steps to develop a national health plan we must never accept a permanent group of unemployed americans with no hope and no stake in building our society for those left out of the economy because of discrimination a lack of skills or poverty we must maintain high levels of training and we must continue to provide jobs a responsible budget is not our only weapon to control inflation we must act now to protect all americans from health care costs that are rising 1 million per hour 24 hours a day doubling every five years we must take control of the largest contributor to that inflation skyrocketing hospital costs there will be no clearer test of the commitment of this congress to the anti inflation fight than the legislation that i will submit again this year to hold down inflation in hospital care over the next five years my proposals will save americans a total of 60 billion of which 25 billion will be savings to the american taxpayer in the federal budget itself the american people have waited long enough this year we must act on hospital cost containment we must also fight inflation by improvements and better enforcement of our antitrust laws and by reducing government obstacles to competition in the private sector we must begin to scrutinize the overall effect of regulation in our economy through deregulation of the airline industry we ve increased profits cut prices for all americans and begun for one of the few times in the history of our nation to actually dismantle a major federal bureaucracy this year we must begin the effort to reform our regulatory processes for the railroad bus and the trucking industries america has the greatest economic system in the world let s reduce government interference and give it a chance to work i call on congress to take other anti inflation action to expand our exports to protect american jobs threatened by unfair trade to conserve energy to increase production and to speed development of solar power and to reassess our nation s technological superiority american workers who enlist in the fight against inflation deserve not just our gratitude but they deserve the protection of the real wage insurance proposal that i have already made to the congress to be successful we must change our attitudes as well as our policies we cannot afford to live beyond our means we cannot afford to create programs that we can neither manage nor finance or to waste our natural resources and we cannot tolerate mismanagement and fraud above all we must meet the challenges of inflation as a united people with the support of the american people government in recent decades has helped to dismantle racial barriers has provided assistance for the jobless and the retired has fed the hungry has protected the safety health and bargaining rights of american workers and has helped to preserve our natural heritage but it s not enough to have created a lot of government programs now we must make the good programs more effective and improve or weed out those which are wasteful or unnecessary with the support of the congress we ve begun to reorganize and to get control of the bureaucracy we are reforming the civil service system so that we can recognize and reward those who do a good job and correct or remove those who do not this year we must extend major reorganization efforts to education to economic development and to the management of our natural resources we need to enact a sunshine sunset law that when government programs have outlived their value they will automatically be terminated there s no such thing as an effective and a noncontroversial reorganization and reform but we know that honest effective government is essential to restore public faith in our public action none of us can be satisfied when two thirds of the american citizens chose not to vote last year in a national election too many americans feel powerless against the influence of private lobbying groups and the unbelievable flood of private campaign money which threatens our electoral process this year we must regain the public s faith by requiring limited financial funds from public funds for congressional election campaigns house bill 1 provides for this public financing of campaigns and i look forward with a great deal of anticipation to signing it at an early date a strong economy and an effective government will restore confidence in america but the path of the future must be charted in peace we must continue to build a new and a firm foundation for a stable world community we are building that new foundation from a position of national strength the strength of our own defenses the strength of our friendships with other nations and of our oldest american ideals america s military power is a major force for security and stability in the world we must maintain our strategic capability and continue the progress of the last two years with our nato allies with whom we have increased our readiness modernized our equipment and strengthened our defense forces in europe i urge you to support the strong defense budget which i have proposed to the congress but our national security in this complicated age requires more than just military might in less than a lifetime world population has more than doubled colonial empires have disappeared and a hundred new nations have been born mass communications literacy and migration to the world s cities have all awakened new yearnings for economic justice and human rights among people everywhere this demand for justice and human rights is a wave of the future in such a world the choice is not which super power will dominate the world none can and none will the choice instead is between a world of anarchy and destruction or a world of cooperation and peace in such a world we seek not to stifle inevitable change but to influence its course in helpful and constructive ways that enhance our values our national interests and the cause of peace towering over this volatile changing world like a thundercloud on a summer day looms the awesome power of nuclear weapons we will continue to help shape the forces of change to anticipate emerging problems of nuclear proliferation and conventional arms sales and to use our great strength and influence to settle international conflicts in other parts of the world before they erupt and spread we have no desire to be the world s policeman but america does want to be the world s peacemaker we are building the foundation for truly global cooperation not only with western and industrialized nations but with the developing countries as well our ties with japan and our european allies are stronger than ever and so are our friendly relations with the people of latin america africa and the western pacific and asia we ve won new respect in this hemisphere with the panama canal treaties we ve gained new trust with the developing world through our opposition to racism our commitment to human rights and our support for majority rule in africa the multilateral trade negotiations are now reaching a successful conclusion and congressional approval is essential to the economic well being of our own country and of the world this will be one of our top priorities in 1979 we are entering a hopeful era in our relations with one fourth of the world s people who live in china the presence of vice premier deng xiaoping next week will help to inaugurate that new era and with prompt congressional action on authorizing legislation we will continue our commitment to a prosperous peaceful and secure life for the people of taiwan i m grateful that in the past year as in the year before no american has died in combat anywhere in the world and in iran nicaragua cyprus namibia and rhodesia our country is working for peaceful solutions to dangerous conflicts in the middle east under the most difficult circumstances we have sought to help ancient enemies lay aside deep seated differences that have produced four bitter wars in our lifetime our firm commitment to israel s survival and security is rooted in our deepest convictions and in our knowledge of the strategic importance to our own nation of a stable middle east to promote peace and reconciliation in the region we must retain the trust and the confidence both of israel and also of the arab nations that are sincerely searching for peace i am determined as president to use the full beneficial influence of our country so that the precious opportunity for lasting peace between israel and egypt will not be lost the new foundation of international cooperation that we seek excludes no nation cooperation with the soviet union serves the cause of peace for in this nuclear age world peace must include peace between the super powers and it must mean the control of nuclear arms ten years ago the united states and the soviet union made the historic decision to open the strategic arms limitations talks or salt the purpose of salt then as now is not to gain a unilateral advantage for either nation but to protect the security of both nations to reverse the costly and dangerous momentum of the nuclear arms race to preserve a stable balance of nuclear forces and to demonstrate to a concerned world that we are determined to help preserve the peace the first salt agreement was concluded in 1972 and since then during six years of negotiation by both republican and democratic leaders nearly all issues of salt ii have been resolved if the soviet union continues to negotiate in good faith a responsible salt agreement will be reached it s important that the american people understand the nature of the salt process salt ii is not based on sentiment it s based on self interest of the united states and of the soviet union both nations share a powerful common interest in reducing the threat of a nuclear war i will sign no agreement which does not enhance our national security salt ii does not rely on trust it will be verifiable we have very sophisticated proven means including our satellites to determine for ourselves whether or not the soviet union is meeting its treaty obligations i will sign no agreement which cannot he verified the american nuclear deterrent will remain strong after salt ii for example just one of our relatively invulnerable poseidon submarines comprising less than 2 percent of our total nuclear force of submarines aircraft and landbased missiles carries enough warheads to destroy every large and medium sized city in the soviet union our deterrent is overwhelming and i will sign no agreement unless our deterrent force will remain overwhelming a salt agreement of course cannot substitute for wise diplomacy or a strong defense nor will it end the danger of nuclear war but it will certainly reduce that danger it will strengthen our efforts to ban nuclear tests and to stop the spread of atomic weapons to other nations and it can begin the process of negotiating new agreements which will further limit nuclear arms the path of arms control backed by a strong defense the path our nation and every president has walked for 30 years can lead to a world of law and of international negotiation and consultation in which all peoples might live in peace in this year 1979 nothing is more important than that the congress and the people of the united states resolve to continue with me on that path of nuclear arms control and world peace this is paramount i ve outlined some of the changes that have transformed the world and which are continuing as we meet here tonight but we in america need not fear change the values on which our nation was founded individual liberty self determination the potential for human fulfillment in freedom all of these endure we find these democratic principles praised even in books smuggled out of totalitarian nations and on wallposters in lands which we thought were closed to our influence our country has regained its special place of leadership in the worldwide struggle for human rights and that is a commitment that we must keep at home as well as abroad the civil rights revolution freed all americans black and white but its full promise still remains unrealized i will continue to work with all my strength for equal opportunity for all americans and for affirmative action for those who carry the extra burden of past denial of equal opportunity we remain committed to improving our labor laws to better protect the rights of american workers and our nation must make it clear that the legal rights of women as citizens are guaranteed under the laws of our land by ratifying the equal rights amendment as long as i m president at home and around the world america s examples and america s influence will be marshaled to advance the cause of human rights to establish those values two centuries ago a bold generation of americans risked their property their position and life itself we are their heirs and they are sending us a message across the centuries the words they made so vivid are now growing faintly indistinct because they are not heard often enough they are words like justice equality unity truth sacrifice liberty faith and love these words remind us that the duty of our generation of americans is to renew our nation s faith not focused just against foreign threats but against the threats of selfishness cynicism and apathy the new foundation i ve discussed tonight can help us build a nation and a world where every child is nurtured and can look to the future with hope where the resources now wasted on war can be turned towards meeting human needs where all people have enough to eat a decent home and protection against disease it can help us build a nation and a world where all people are free to seek the truth and to add to human understanding so that all of us may live our lives in peace tonight i ask you the members of the congress to join me in building that new foundation a better foundation for our beloved country and our world thank you very much

the repeal of the missouri compromise and the propriety of its restoration constitute the subject of what i am about to say as i desire to present my own connected view of this subject my remarks will not be specifically an answer to judge douglas yet as i proceed the main points he has presented will arise and will receive such respectful attention as i may be able to give them i wish further to say that i do not propose to question the patriotism or to assail the motives of any man or class of men but rather to strictly confine myself to the naked merits of the question i also wish to be no less than national in all the positions i may take and whenever i take ground which others have thought or may think narrow sectional and dangerous to the union i hope to give a reason which will appear sufficient at least to some why i think differently and as this subject is no other than part and parcel of the larger general question of domestic slavery i wish to make and to keep the distinction between the existing institution and the extension of it so broad and so clear that no honest man can misunderstand me and no dishonest one successfully misrepresent me in order to a clear understanding of what the missouri compromise is a short history of the preceding kindred subjects will perhaps be proper when we established our independence we did not own or claim the country to which this compromise applies indeed strictly speaking the confederacy then owned no country at all the states respectively owned the country within their limits and some of them owned territory beyond their strict state limits virginia thus owned the north western territory the country out of which the principal part of ohio all indiana all illinois all michigan and all wisconsin have since been formed she also owned perhaps within her then limits what has since been formed into the state of kentucky north carolina thus owned what is now the state of tennessee and south carolina and georgia in separate parts owned what are now mississippi and alabama connecticut i think owned the little remaining part of ohio being the same where they now send giddings to congress and beat all creation at making cheese these territories together with the states themselves constituted all the country over which the confederacy then claimed any sort of jurisdiction we were then living under the articles of confederation which were superceded by the constitution several years afterwards the question of ceding these territories to the general government was set on foot mr jefferson the author of the declaration of independence and otherwise a chief actor in the revolution then a delegate in congress afterwards twice president who was is and perhaps will continue to be the most distinguished politician of our history a virginian by birth and continued residence and withal a slave holder conceived the idea of taking that occasion to prevent slavery ever going into the north western territory he prevailed on the virginia legislature to adopt his views and to cede the territory making the prohibition of slavery therein a condition of the deed congress accepted the cession with the condition and in the first ordinance which the acts of congress were then called for the government of the territory provided that slavery should never be permitted therein this is the famed ordinance of 87 so often spoken of thenceforward for sixty one years and until in 1848 the last scrap of this territory came into the union as the state of wisconsin all parties acted in quiet obedience to this ordinance it is now what jefferson foresaw and intended the happy home of teeming millions of free white prosperous people and no slave amongst them thus with the author of the declaration of independence the policy of prohibiting slavery in new territory originated thus away back of the constitution in the pure fresh free breath of the revolution the state of virginia and the national congress put that policy in practice thus through sixty odd of the best years of the republic did that policy steadily work to its great and beneficent end and thus in those five states and five millions of free enterprising people we have before us the rich fruits of this policy but now new light breaks upon us now congress declares this ought never to have been and the like of it must never be again the sacred right of self government is grossly violated by it we even find some men who drew their first breath and every other breath of their lives under this very restriction now live in dread of absolute suffocation if they should be restricted in the sacred right of taking slaves to nebraska that perfect liberty they sigh for the liberty of making slaves of other people jefferson never thought of their own father never thought of they never thought of themselves a year ago how fortunate for them they did not sooner become sensible of their great misery oh how difficult it is to treat with respect such assaults upon all we have ever really held sacred but to return to history in 1803 we purchased what was then called louisiana of france it included the now states of louisiana arkansas missouri and iowa also the territory of minnesota and the present bone of contention kansas and nebraska slavery already existed among the french at new orleans and to some extent at st louis in 1812 louisiana came into the union as a slave state without controversy in 1818 or 19 missouri showed signs of a wish to come in with slavery this was resisted by northern members of congress and thus began the first great slavery agitation in the nation this controversy lasted several months and became very angry and exciting the house of representatives voting steadily for the prohibition of slavery in missouri and the senate voting as steadily against it threats of breaking up the union were freely made and the ablest public men of the day became seriously alarmed at length a compromise was made in which like all compromises both sides yielded something it was a law passed on the 6th day of march 1820 providing that missouri might come into the union with slavery but that in all the remaining part of the territory purchased of france which lies north of 36 degrees and 30 minutes north latitude slavery should never be permitted this provision of law is the missouri compromise in excluding slavery north of the line the same language is employed as in the ordinance of 87 it directly applied to iowa minnesota and to the present bone of contention kansas and nebraska whether there should or should not be slavery south of that line nothing was said in the law but arkansas constituted the principal remaining part south of the line and it has since been admitted as a slave state without serious controversy more recently iowa north of the line came in as a free state without controversy still later minnesota north of the line had a territorial organization without controversy texas principally south of the line and west of arkansas though originally within the purchase from france had in 1819 been traded off to spain in our treaty for the acquisition of florida it had thus become a part of mexico mexico revolutionized and became independent of spain american citizens began settling rapidly with their slaves in the southern part of texas soon they revolutionized against mexico and established an independent government of their own adopting a constitution with slavery strongly resembling the constitutions of our slave states by still another rapid move texas claiming a boundary much further west than when we parted with her in 1819 was brought back to the united states and admitted into the union as a slave state there then was little or no settlement in the northern part of texas a considerable portion of which lay north of the missouri line and in the resolutions admitting her into the union the missouri restriction was expressly extended westward across her territory this was in 1845 only nine years ago thus originated the missouri compromise and thus has it been respected down to 1845 and even four years later in 1849 our distinguished senator in a public address held the following language in relation to it the missouri compromise had been in practical operation for about a quarter of a century and had received the sanction and approbation of men of all parties in every section of the union it had allayed all sectional jealousies and irritations growing out of this vexed question and harmonized and tranquilized the whole country it had given to henry clay as its prominent champion the proud sobriquet of the great pacificator and by that title and for that service his political friends had repeatedly appealed to the people to rally under his standard as a presidential candidate as the man who had exhibited the patriotism and the power to suppress an unholy and treasonable agitation and preserve the union he was not aware that any man or any party from any section of the union had ever urged as an objection to mr clay that he was the great champion of the missouri compromise on the contrary the effort was made by the opponents of mr clay to prove that he was not entitled to the exclusive merit of that great patriotic measure and that the honor was equally due to others as well as to him for securing its adoption that it had its origin in the hearts of all patriotic men who desired to preserve and perpetuate the blessings of our glorious union an origin akin that of the constitution of the united states conceived in the same spirit of fraternal affection and calculated to remove forever the only danger which seemed to threaten at some distant day to sever the social bond of union all the evidences of public opinion at that day seemed to indicate that this compromise had been canonized in the hearts of the american people as a sacred thing which no ruthless hand would ever be reckless enough to disturb i do not read this extract to involve judge douglas in an inconsistency if he afterwards thought he had been wrong it was right for him to change i bring this forward merely to show the high estimate placed on the missouri compromise by all parties up to so late as the year 1849 but going back a little in point of time our war with mexico broke out in 1846 when congress was about adjourning that session president polk asked them to place two millions of dollars under his control to be used by him in the recess if found practicable and expedient in negociating a treaty of peace with mexico and acquiring some part of her territory a bill was duly got up for the purpose and was progressing swimmingly in the house of representatives when a member by the name of david wilmot a democrat from pennsylvania moved as an amendment provided that in any territory thus acquired there shall never be slavery this is the origin of the far famed wilmot proviso it created a great flutter but it stuck like wax was voted into the bill and the bill passed with it through the house the senate however adjourned without final action on it and so both appropriation and proviso were lost for the time the war continued and at the next session the president renewed his request for the appropriation enlarging the amount i think to three million again came the proviso and defeated the measure congress adjourned again and the war went on in dec 1847 the new congress assembled i was in the lower house that term the wilmot proviso or the principle of it was constantly coming up in some shape or other and i think i may venture to say i voted for it at least forty times during the short term i was there the senate however held it in check and it never became law in the spring of 1848 a treaty of peace was made with mexico by which we obtained that portion of her country which now constitutes the territories of new mexico and utah and the now state of california by this treaty the wilmot proviso was defeated as so far as it was intended to be a condition of the acquisition of territory its friends however were still determined to find some way to restrain slavery from getting into the new country this new acquisition lay directly west of our old purchase from france and extended west to the pacific ocean and was so situated that if the missouri line should be extended straight west the new country would be divided by such extended line leaving some north and some south of it on judge douglas motion a bill or provision of a bill passed the senate to so extend the missouri line the proviso men in the house including myself voted it down because by implication it gave up the southern part to slavery while we were bent on having it all free in the fall of 1848 the gold mines were discovered in california this attracted people to it with unprecedented rapidity so that on or soon after the meeting of the new congress in dec 1849 she already had a population of nearly a hundred thousand had called a convention formed a state constitution excluding slavery and was knocking for admission into the union the proviso men of course were for letting her in but the senate always true to the other side would not consent to her admission and there california stood kept out of the union because she would not let slavery into her borders under all the circumstances perhaps this was not wrong there were other points of dispute connected with the general question of slavery which equally needed adjustment the south clamored for a more efficient fugitive slave law the north clamored for the abolition of a peculiar species of slave trade in the district of columbia in connection with which in view from the windows of the capitol a sort of negro livery stable where droves of negroes were collected temporarily kept and finally taken to southern markets precisely like droves of horses had been openly maintained for fifty years utah and new mexico needed territorial governments and whether slavery should or should not be prohibited within them was another question the indefinite western boundary of texas was to be settled she was received a slave state and consequently the farther west the slavery men could push her boundary the more slave country they secured and the farther east the slavery opponents could thrust the boundary back the less slave ground was secured thus this was just as clearly a slavery question as any of the others these points all needed adjustment and they were all held up perhaps wisely to make them help to adjust one another the union now as in 1820 was thought to be in danger and devotion to the union rightfully inclined men to yield somewhat in points where nothing else could have so inclined them a compromise was finally effected the south got their new fugitive slave law and the north got california the far best part of our acquisition from mexico as a free state the south got a provision that new mexico and utah when admitted as states may come in with or without slavery as they may then choose and the north got the slave trade abolished in the district of columbia the north got the western boundary of texas thence further back eastward than the south desired but in turn they gave texas ten millions of dollars with which to pay her old debts this is the compromise of 1850 preceding the presidential election of 1852 each of the great political parties democrats and whigs met in convention and adopted resolutions endorsing the compromise of 50 as a finality a final settlement so far as these parties could make it so of all slavery agitation previous to this in 1851 the illinois legislature had indorsed it during this long period of time nebraska had remained substantially an uninhabited country but now emigration to and settlement within it began to take place it is about one third as large as the present united states and its importance so long overlooked begins to come into view the restriction of slavery by the missouri compromise directly applies to it in fact was first made and has since been maintained expressly for it in 1853 a bill to give it a territorial government passed the house of representatives and in the hands of judge douglas failed of passing the senate only for want of time this bill contained no repeal of the missouri compromise indeed when it was assailed because it did not contain such repeal judge douglas defended it in its existing form on january 4th 1854 judge douglas introduces a new bill to give nebraska territorial government he accompanies this bill with a report in which last he expressly recommends that the missouri compromise shall neither be affirmed nor repealed before long the bill is so modified as to make two territories instead of one calling the southern one kansas also about a month after the introduction of the bill on the judge s own motion it is so amended as to declare the missouri compromise inoperative and void and substantially that the people who go and settle there may establish slavery or exclude it as they may see fit in this shape the bill passed both branches of congress and became a law this is the repeal of the missouri compromise the foregoing history may not be precisely accurate in every particular but i am sure it is sufficiently so for all the uses i shall attempt to make of it and in it we have before us the chief material enabling us to correctly judge whether the repeal of the missouri compromise is right or wrong i think and shall try to show that it is wrong wrong in its direct effect letting slavery into kansas and nebraska and wrong in its prospective principle allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world where men can be found inclined to take it this declared indifference but as i must think covert real zeal for the spread of slavery i can not but hate i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world enables the enemies of free institutions with plausibility to taunt us as hypocrites causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity and especially because it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty criticising the declaration of independence and insisting that there is no right principle of action but self interest before proceeding let me say i think i have no prejudice against the southern people they are just what we would be in their situation if slavery did not now exist amongst them they would not introduce it if it did now exist amongst us we should not instantly give it up this i believe of the masses north and south doubtless there are individuals on both sides who would not hold slaves under any circumstances and others who would gladly introduce slavery anew if it were out of existence we know that some southern men do free their slaves go north and become tip top abolitionists while some northern ones go south and become most cruel slave masters when southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we i acknowledge the fact when it is said that the institution exists and that it is very difficult to get rid of it in any satisfactory way i can understand and appreciate the saying i surely will not blame them for not doing what i should not know how to do myself if all earthly power were given me i should not know what to do as to the existing institution my first impulse would be to free all the slaves and send them to liberia to their own native land but a moment s reflection would convince me that whatever of high hope as i think there is there may be in this in the long run its sudden execution is impossible if they were all landed there in a day they would all perish in the next ten days and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough in the world to carry them there in many times ten days what then free them all and keep them among us as underlings is it quite certain that this betters their condition i think i would not hold one in slavery at any rate yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce people upon what next free them and make them politically and socially our equals my own feelings will not admit of this and if mine would we well know that those of the great mass of white people will not whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment is not the sole question if indeed it is any part of it a universal feeling whether well or ill founded can not be safely disregarded we can not then make them equals it does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted but for their tardiness in this i will not undertake to judge our brethren of the south when they remind us of their constitutional rights i acknowledge them not grudgingly but fully and fairly and i would give them any legislation for the reclaiming of their fugitives which should not in its stringency be more likely to carry a free man into slavery than our ordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one but all this to my judgment furnishes no more excuse for permitting slavery to go into our own free territory than it would for reviving the african slave trade by law the law which forbids the bringing of slaves from africa and that which has so long forbid the taking them to nebraska can hardly be distinguished on any moral principle and the repeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuses as that of the latter the arguments by which the repeal of the missouri compromise is sought to be justified are these first that the nebraska country needed a territorial government second that in various ways the public had repudiated it and demanded the repeal and therefore should not now complain of it and lastly that the repeal establishes a principle which is intrinsically right i will attempt an answer to each of them in its turn first then if that country was in need of a territorial organization could it not have had it as well without as with the repeal iowa and minnesota to both of which the missouri restriction applied had without its repeal each in succession territorial organizations and even the year before a bill for nebraska itself was within an ace of passing without the repealing clause and this in the hands of the same men who are now the champions of repeal why no necessity then for the repeal but still later when this very bill was first brought in it contained no repeal but say they because the public had demanded or rather commanded the repeal the repeal was to accompany the organization whenever that should occur now i deny that the public ever demanded any such thing ever repudiated the missouri compromise ever commanded its repeal i deny it and call for the proof it is not contended i believe that any such command has ever been given in express terms it is only said that it was done in principle the support of the wilmot proviso is the first fact mentioned to prove that the missouri restriction was repudiated in principle and the second is the refusal to extend the missouri line over the country acquired from mexico these are near enough alike to be treated together the one was to exclude the chances of slavery from the whole new acquisition by the lump and the other was to reject a division of it by which one half was to be given up to those chances now whether this was a repudiation of the missouri line in principle depends upon whether the missouri law contained any principle requiring the line to be extended over the country acquired from mexico i contend it did not i insist that it contained no general principle but that it was in every sense specific that its terms limit it to the country purchased from france is undenied and undeniable it could have no principle beyond the intention of those who made it they did not intend to extend the line to country which they did not own if they intended to extend it in the event of acquiring additional territory why did they not say so it was just as easy to say that in all the country west of the mississippi which we now own or may hereafter acquire there shall never be slavery as to say what they did say and they would have said it if they had meant it an intention to extend the law is not only not mentioned in the law but is not mentioned in any contemporaneous history both the law itself and the history of the times are a blank as to any principle of extension and by neither the known rules for construing statutes and contracts nor by common sense can any such principle be inferred another fact showing the specific character of the missouri law showing that it intended no more than it expressed showing that the line was not intended as a universal dividing line between free and slave territory present and prospective north of which slavery could never go is the fact that by that very law missouri came in as a slave state north of the line if that law contained any prospective principle the whole law must be looked to in order to ascertain what the principle was and by this rule the south could fairly contend that inasmuch as they got one slave state north of the line at the inception of the law they have the right to have another given them north of it occasionally now and then in the indefinite westward extension of the line this demonstrates the absurdity of attempting to deduce a prospective principle from the missouri compromise line when we voted for the wilmot proviso we were voting to keep slavery out of the whole missouri acquisition and little did we think we were thereby voting to let it into nebraska laying several hundred miles distant when we voted against extending the missouri line little did we think we were voting to destroy the old line then of near thirty years standing to argue that we thus repudiated the missouri compromise is no less absurd than it would be to argue that because we have so far forborne to acquire cuba we have thereby in principle repudiated our former acquisitions and determined to throw them out of the union no less absurd than it would be to say that because i may have refused to build an addition to my house i thereby have decided to destroy the existing house and if i catch you setting fire to my house you will turn upon me and say i instructed you to do it the most conclusive argument however that while voting for the wilmot proviso and while voting against the extension of the missouri line we never thought of disturbing the original missouri compromise is found in the facts that there was then and still is an unorganized tract of fine country nearly as large as the state of missouri lying immediately west of arkansas and south of the missouri compromise line and that we never attempted to prohibit slavery as to it i wish particular attention to this it adjoins the original missouri compromise line by its northern boundary and consequently is part of the country into which by implication slavery was permitted to go by that compromise there it has lain open ever since and there it still lies and yet no effort has been made at any time to wrest it from the south in all our struggles to prohibit slavery within our mexican acquisitions we never so much as lifted a finger to prohibit it as to this tract is not this entirely conclusive that at all times we have held the missouri compromise as a sacred thing even when against ourselves as well as when for us senator douglas sometimes says the missouri line itself was in principle only an extension of the line of the ordinance of 87 that is to say an extension of the ohio river i think this is weak enough on its face i will remark however that as a glance at the map will show the missouri line is a long way farther south than the ohio and that if our senator in proposing his extension had stuck to the principle of jogging southward perhaps it might not have been voted down so readily but next it is said that the compromises of 50 and the ratification of them by both political parties in 52 established a new principle which required the repeal of the missouri compromise this again i deny i deny it and demand the proof i have already stated fully what the compromises of 50 are the particular part of those measures for which the virtual repeal of the missouri compromise is sought to be inferred for it is admitted they contain nothing about it in express terms is the provision in the utah and new mexico laws which permits them when they seek admission into the union as states to come in with or without slavery as they shall then see fit now i insist this provision was made for utah and new mexico and for no other place whatever it had no more direct reference to nebraska than it had to the territories of the moon but say they it had reference to nebraska in principle let us see the north consented to this provision not because they considered it right in itself but because they were compensated paid for it they at the same time got california into the union as a free state this was far the best part of all they had struggled for by the wilmot proviso they also got the area of slavery somewhat narrowed in the settlement of the boundary of texas also they got the slave trade abolished in the district of columbia for all these desirable objects the north could afford to yield something and they did yield to the south the utah and new mexico provision i do not mean that the whole north or even a majority yielded when the law passed but enough yielded when added to the vote of the south to carry the measure now can it be pretended that the principle of this arrangement requires us to permit the same provision to be applied to nebraska without any equivalent at all give us another free state press the boundary of texas still further back give us another step toward the destruction of slavery in the district and you present us a similar case but ask us not to repeat for nothing what you paid for in the first instance if you wish the thing again pay again that is the principle of the compromises of 50 if indeed they had any principles beyond their specific terms it was the system of equivalents again if congress at that time intended that all future territories should when admitted as states come in with or without slavery at their own option why did it not say so with such an universal provision all know the bills could not have passed did they then could they establish a principle contrary to their own intention still further if they intended to establish the principle that wherever congress had control it should be left to the people to do as they thought fit with slavery why did they not authorize the people of the district of columbia at their adoption to abolish slavery within these limits i personally know that this has not been left undone because it was unthought of it was frequently spoken of by members of congress and by citizens of washington six years ago and i heard no one express a doubt that a system of gradual emancipation with compensation to owners would meet the approbation of a large majority of the white people of the district but without the action of congress they could say nothing and congress said no in the measures of 1850 congress had the subject of slavery in the district expressly in hand if they were then establishing the principle of allowing the people to do as they please with slavery why did they not apply the principle to that people again it is claimed that by the resolutions of the illinois legislature passed in 1851 the repeal of the missouri compromise was demanded this i deny also whatever may be worked out by a criticism of the language of those resolutions the people have never understood them as being any more than an endorsement of the compromises of 1850 and a release of our senators from voting for the wilmot proviso the whole people are living witnesses that this only was their view finally it is asked if we did not mean to apply the utah and new mexico provision to all future territories what did we mean when we in 1852 endorsed the compromises of 50 for myself i can answer this question most easily i meant not to ask a repeal or modification of the fugitive slave law i meant not to ask for the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia i meant not to resist the admission of utah and new mexico even should they ask to come in as slave states i meant nothing about additional territories because as i understood we then had no territory whose character as to slavery was not already settled as to nebraska i regarded its character as being fixed by the missouri compromise for thirty years as unalterably fixed as that of my own home in illinois as to new acquisitions i said sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof when we make new acquaintances we will as heretofore try to manage them some how that is my answer that is what i meant and said and i appeal to the people to say each for himself whether that was not also the universal meaning of the free states and now in turn let me ask a few questions if by any or all these matters the repeal of the missouri compromise was commanded why was not the command sooner obeyed why was the repeal omitted in the nebraska bill of 1853 why was it omitted in the original bill of 1854 why in the accompanying report was such a repeal characterized as a departure from the course pursued in 1850 and its continued omission recommended i am aware judge douglas now argues that the subsequent express repeal is no substantial alteration of the bill this argument seems wonderful to me it is as if one should argue that white and black are not different he admits however that there is a literal change in the bill and that he made the change in deference to other senators who would not support the bill without this proves that those other senators thought the change a substantial one and that the judge thought their opinions worth deferring to his own opinions therefore seem not to rest on a very firm basis even in his own mind and i suppose the world believes and will continue to believe that precisely on the substance of that change this whole agitation has arisen i conclude then that the public never demanded the repeal of the missouri compromise i now come to consider whether the repeal with its avowed principle is intrinsically right i insist that it is not take the particular case a controversy had arisen between the advocates and opponents of slavery in relation to its establishment within the country we had purchased of france the southern and then best part of the purchase was already in as a slave state the controversy was settled by also letting missouri in as a slave state but with the agreement that within all the remaining part of the purchase north of a certain line there should never be slavery as to what was to be done with the remaining part south of the line nothing was said but perhaps the fair implication was that it should come in with slavery if it should so choose the southern part except a portion heretofore mentioned afterwards did come in with slavery as the state of arkansas all these many years since 1820 the northern part had remained a wilderness at length settlements began in it also in due course iowa came in as a free state and minnesota was given a territorial government without removing the slavery restriction finally the sole remaining part north of the line kansas and nebraska was to be organized and it is proposed and carried to blot out the old dividing line of thirty four years standing and to open the whole of that country to the introduction of slavery now this to my mind is manifestly unjust after an angry and dangerous controversy the parties made friends by dividing the bone of contention the one party first appropriates her own share beyond all power to be disturbed in the possession of it and then seizes the share of the other party it is as if two starving men had divided their only loaf the one had hastily swallowed his half and then grabbed the other half just as he was putting it to his mouth let me here drop the main argument to notice what i consider rather an inferior matter it is argued that slavery will not go to kansas and nebraska in any event this is a palliation a lullaby i have some hope that it will not but let us not be too confident as to climate a glance at the map shows that there are five slave states delaware maryland virginia kentucky and missouri and also the district of columbia all north of the missouri compromise line the census returns of 1850 show that within these there are 867 276 slaves being more than one fourth of all the slaves in the nation it is not climate then that will keep slavery out of these territories is there any thing in the peculiar nature of the country missouri adjoins these territories by her entire western boundary and slavery is already within every one of her western counties i have even heard it said that there are more slaves in proportion to whites in the north western county of missouri than within any county of the state slavery pressed entirely up to the old western boundary of the state and when rather recently a part of that boundary at the north west was moved out a little farther west slavery followed on quite up to the new line now when the restriction is removed what is to prevent it from going still further climate will not no peculiarity of the country will nothing in nature will will the disposition of the people prevent it those nearest the scene are all in favor of the extension the yankees who are opposed to it may be more numerous but in military phrase the battle field is too far from their base of operations but it is said there now is no law in nebraska on the subject of slavery and that in such case taking a slave there operates his freedom that is good book law but is not the rule of actual practice wherever slavery is it has been first introduced without law the oldest laws we find concerning it are not laws introducing it but regulating it as an already existing thing a white man takes his slave to nebraska now who will inform the negro that he is free who will take him before court to test the question of his freedom in ignorance of his legal emancipation he is kept chopping splitting and plowing others are brought and move on in the same track at last if ever the time for voting comes on the question of slavery the institution already in fact exists in the country and cannot well be removed the facts of its presence and the difficulty of its removal will carry the vote in its favor keep it out until a vote is taken and a vote in favor of it can not be got in any population of forty thousand on earth who have been drawn together by the ordinary motives of emigration and settlement to get slaves into the country simultaneously with the whites in the incipient stages of settlement is the precise stake played for and won in this nebraska measure the question is asked us if slaves will go in notwithstanding the general principle of law liberates them why would they not equally go in against positive statute law go in even if the missouri restriction were maintained i answer because it takes a much bolder man to venture in with his property in the latter case than in the former because the positive congressional enactment is known to and respected by all or nearly all whereas the negative principle that no law is free law is not much known except among lawyers we have some experience of this practical difference in spite of the ordinance of 87 a few negroes were brought into illinois and held in a state of quasi slavery not enough however to carry a vote of the people in favor of the institution when they came to form a constitution but in the adjoining missouri country where there was no ordinance of 87 was no restriction they were carried ten times nay a hundred times as fast and actually made a slave state this is fact naked fact another lullaby argument is that taking slaves to new countries does not increase their number does not make any one slave who otherwise would be free there is some truth in this and i am glad of it but it not wholly true the african slave trade is not yet effectually suppressed and if we make a reasonable deduction for the white people amongst us who are foreigners and the descendants of foreigners arriving here since 1808 we shall find the increase of the black population out running that of the white to an extent unaccountable except by supposing that some of them too have been coming from africa if this be so the opening of new countries to the institution increases the demand for and augments the price of slaves and so does in fact make slaves of freemen by causing them to be brought from africa and sold into bondage but however this may be we know the opening of new countries to slavery tends to the perpetuation of the institution and so does keep men in slavery who otherwise would be free this result we do not feel like favoring and we are under no legal obligation to suppress our feelings in this respect equal justice to the south it is said requires us to consent to the extending of slavery to new countries that is to say inasmuch as you do not object to my taking my hog to nebraska therefore i must not object to you taking your slave now i admit this is perfectly logical if there is no difference between hogs and negroes but while you thus require me to deny the humanity of the negro i wish to ask whether you of the south yourselves have ever been willing to do as much it is kindly provided that of all those who come into the world only a small percentage are natural tyrants that percentage is no larger in the slave states than in the free the great majority south as well as north have human sympathies of which they can no more divest themselves than they can of their sensibility to physical pain these sympathies in the bosoms of the southern people manifest in many ways their sense of the wrong of slavery and their consciousness that after all there is humanity in the negro if they deny this let me address them a few plain questions in 1820 you joined the north almost unanimously in declaring the african slave trade piracy and in annexing to it the punishment of death why did you do this if you did not feel that it was wrong why did you join in providing that men should be hung for it the practice was no more than bringing wild negroes from africa to sell to such as would buy them but you never thought of hanging men for catching and selling wild horses wild buffaloes or wild bears again you have amongst you a sneaking individual of the class of native tyrants known as the slave dealer he watches your necessities and crawls up to buy your slave at a speculating price if you cannot help it you sell to him but if you can help it you drive him from your door you despise him utterly you do not recognize him as a friend or even as an honest man your children must not play with his they may rollick freely with the little negroes but not with the slave dealers children if you are obliged to deal with him you try to get through the job without so much as touching him it is common with you to join hands with the men you meet but with the slave dealer you avoid the ceremony instinctively shrinking from the snaky contact if he grows rich and retires from business you still remember him and still keep up the ban of non intercourse upon him and his family now why is this you do not so treat the man who deals in corn cattle or tobacco and yet again there are in the united states and territories including the district of columbia 433 643 free blacks at 500 per head they are worth over two hundred millions of dollars how comes this vast amount of property to be running about without owners we do not see free horses or free cattle running at large how is this all these free blacks are the descendants of slaves or have been slaves themselves and they would be slaves now but for something which has operated on their white owners inducing them at vast pecuniary sacrifices to liberate them what is that something is there any mistaking it in all these cases it is your sense of justice and human sympathy continually telling you that the poor negro has some natural right to himself that those who deny it and make mere merchandise of him deserve kickings contempt and death and now why will you ask us to deny the humanity of the slave and estimate him only as the equal of the hog why ask us to do what you will not do yourselves why ask us to do for nothing what two hundred million of dollars could not induce you to do but one great argument in the support of the repeal of the missouri compromise is still to come that argument is the sacred right of self government it seems our distinguished senator has found great difficulty in getting his antagonists even in the senate to meet him fairly on this argument some poet has said fools rush in where angels fear to tread at the hazzard of being thought one of the fools of this quotation i meet that argument i rush in i take that bull by the horns i trust i understand and truly estimate the right of self government my faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own lies at the foundation of the sense of justice there is in me i extend the principles to communities of men as well as to individuals i so extend it because it is politically wise as well as naturally just politically wise in saving us from broils about matters which do not concern us here or at washington i would not trouble myself with the oyster laws of virginia or the cranberry laws of indiana the doctrine of self government is right absolutely and eternally right but it has no just application as here attempted or perhaps i should rather say that whether it has such just application depends upon whether a negro is not or is a man if he is not a man why in that case he who is a man may as a matter of self government do just as he pleases with him but if the negro is a man is it not to that extent a total destruction of self government to say that he too shall not govern himself when the white man governs himself that is self government but when he governs himself and also governs another man that is more than self government that is despotism if the negro is a man why then my ancient faith teaches me that all men are created equal and that there can be no moral right in connection with one man s making a slave of another judge douglas frequently with bitter irony and sarcasm paraphrases our argument by saying the white people of nebraska are good enough to govern themselves but they are not good enough to govern a few miserable negroes well i doubt not that the people of nebraska are and will continue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere i do not say the contrary what i do say is that no man is good enough to govern another man without that other s consent i say this is the leading principle the sheet anchor of american republicanism our declaration of independence says we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed i have quoted so much at this time merely to show that according to our ancient faith the just powers of governments are derived from the consent of the governed now the relation of masters and slaves is pro tanto a total violation of this principle the master not only governs the slave without his consent but he governs him by a set of rules altogether different from those which he prescribes for himself allow all the governed an equal voice in the government and that and that only is self government let it not be said i am contending for the establishment of political and social equality between the whites and blacks i have already said the contrary i am not now combating the argument of necessity arising from the fact that the blacks are already amongst us but i am combating what is set up as moral argument for allowing them to be taken where they have never yet been arguing against the extension of a bad thing which where it already exists we must of necessity manage as we best can in support of his application of the doctrine of self government senator douglas has sought to bring to his aid the opinions and examples of our revolutionary fathers i am glad he has done this i love the sentiments of those old time men and shall be most happy to abide by their opinions he shows us that when it was in contemplation for the colonies to break off from great britain and set up a new government for themselves several of the states instructed their delegates to go for the measure provided each state should be allowed to regulate its domestic concerns in its own way i do not quote but this in substance this was right i see nothing objectionable in it i also think it probable that it had some reference to the existence of slavery amongst them i will not deny that it had but had it in any reference to the carrying of slavery into new countries that is the question and we will let the fathers themselves answer it this same generation of men and mostly the same individuals of the generation who declared this principle who declared independence who fought the war of the revolution through who afterwards made the constitution under which we still live these same men passed the ordinance of 87 declaring that slavery should never go to the north west territory i have no doubt judge douglas thinks they were very inconsistent in this it is a question of discrimination between them and him but there is not an inch of ground left for his claiming that their opinions their example their authority are on his side in this controversy again is not nebraska while a territory a part of us do we not own the country and if we surrender the control of it do we not surrender the right of self government it is part of ourselves if you say we shall not control it because it is only part the same is true of every other part and when all the parts are gone what has become of the whole what is then left of us what use for the general government when there is nothing left for it govern but you say this question should be left to the people of nebraska because they are more particularly interested if this be the rule you must leave it to each individual to say for himself whether he will have slaves what better moral right have thirty one citizens of nebraska to say that the thirty second shall not hold slaves than the people of the thirty one states have to say that slavery shall not go into the thirty second state at all but if it is a sacred right for the people of nebraska to take and hold slaves there it is equally their sacred right to buy them where they can buy them cheapest and that undoubtedly will be on the coast of africa provided you will consent to not hang them for going there to buy them you must remove this restriction too from the sacred right of self government i am aware you say that taking slaves from the states of nebraska does not make slaves of freemen but the african slave trader can say just as much he does not catch free negroes and bring them here he finds them already slaves in the hands of their black captors and he honestly buys them at the rate of about a red cotton handkerchief a head this is very cheap and it is a great abridgement of the sacred right of self government to hang men for engaging in this profitable trade another important objection to this application of the right of self government is that it enables the first few to deprive the succeeding many of a free exercise of the right of self government the first few may get slavery in and the subsequent many cannot easily get it out how common is the remark now in the slave states if we were only clear of our slaves how much better it would be for us they are actually deprived of the privilege of governing themselves as they would by the action of a very few in the beginning the same thing was true of the whole nation at the time our constitution was formed whether slavery shall go into nebraska or other new territories is not a matter of exclusive concern to the people who may go there the whole nation is interested that the best use shall be made of these territories we want them for the homes of free white people this they cannot be to any considerable extent if slavery shall be planted within them slave states are places for poor white people to remove from not to remove to new free states are the places for poor people to go to and better their condition for this use the nation needs these territories still further there are constitutional relations between the slave and free states which are degrading to the latter we are under legal obligations to catch and return their runaway slaves to them a sort of dirty disagreeable job which i believe as a general rule the slave holders will not perform for one another then again in the control of the government the management of the partnership affairs they have greatly the advantage of us by the constitution each state has two senators each has a number of representatives in proportion to the number of its people and each has a number of presidential electors equal to the whole number of its senators and representatives together but in ascertaining the number of the people for this purpose five slaves are counted as being equal to three whites the slaves do not vote they are only counted and so used as to swell the influence of the white people s votes the practical effect of this is more aptly shown by a comparison of the states of south carolina and maine south carolina has six representatives and so has maine south carolina has eight presidential electors and so has maine this is precise equality so far and of course they are equal in senators each having two thus in the control of the government the two states are equals precisely but how are they in the number of their white people maine has 581 813 while south carolina has 274 567 maine has twice as many as south carolina and 32 679 over thus each white man in south carolina is more than the double of any man in maine this is all because south carolina besides her free people has 384 984 slaves the south carolinian has precisely the same advantage over the white man in every other free state as well as in maine he is more than the double of any one of us in this crowd the same advantage but not to the same extent is held by all the citizens of the slave states over those of the free and it is an absolute truth without an exception that there is no voter in any slave state but who has more legal power in the government than any voter in any free state there is no instance of exact equality and the disadvantage is against us the whole chapter through this principle in the aggregate gives the slave states in the present congress twenty additional representatives being seven more than the whole majority by which they passed the nebraska bill now all this is manifestly unfair yet i do not mention it to complain of it in so far as it is already settled it is in the constitution and i do not for that cause or any other cause propose to destroy or alter or disregard the constitution i stand to it fairly fully and firmly but when i am told i must leave it altogether to other people to say whether new partners are to be bred up and brought into the firm on the same degrading terms against me i respectfully demur i insist that whether i shall be a whole man or only the half of one in comparison with others is a question in which i am somewhat concerned and one which no other man can have a sacred right of deciding for me if i am wrong in this if it really be a sacred right of self government in the man who shall go to nebraska to decide whether he will be the equal of me or the double of me then after he shall have exercised that right and thereby shall have reduced me to a still smaller fraction of a man than i already am i should like for some gentleman deeply skilled in the mysteries of sacred rights to provide himself with a microscope and peep about and find out if he can what has become of my sacred rights they will surely be too small for detection with the naked eye finally i insist that if there is any thing which it is the duty of the whole people to never entrust to any hands but their own that thing is the preservation and perpetuity of their own liberties and institutions and if they shall think as i do that the extension of slavery endangers them more than any or all other causes how recreant to themselves if they submit the question and with it the fate of their country to a mere hand full of men bent only on temporary self interest if this question of slavery extension were an insignificant one one having no power to do harm it might be shuffled aside in this way but being as it is the great behemoth of danger shall the strong gripe of the nation be loosened upon him to entrust him to the hands of such feeble keepers i have done with this mighty argument of self government go sacred thing go in peace but nebraska is urged as a great union saving measure well i too go for saving the union much as i hate slavery i would consent to the extension of it rather than see the union dissolved just as i would consent to any great evil to avoid a greater one but when i go to union saving i must believe at least that the means i employ has some adaptation to the end to my mind nebraska has no such adaptation it hath no relish of salvation in it it is an aggravation rather of the only one thing which ever endangers the union when it came upon us all was peace and quiet the nation was looking to the forming of new bonds of union and a long course of peace and prosperity seemed to lie before us in the whole range of possibility there scarcely appears to me to have been any thing out of which the slavery agitation could have been revived except the very project of repealing the missouri compromise every inch of territory we owned already had a definite settlement of the slavery question and by which all parties were pledged to abide indeed there was no uninhabited country on the continent which we could acquire if we except some extreme northern regions which are wholly out of the question in this state of case the genius of discord himself could scarcely have invented a way of again getting us by the ears but by turning back and destroying the peace measures of the past the councils of that genius seem to have prevailed the missouri compromise was repealed and here we are in the midst of a new slavery agitation such i think as we have never seen before who is responsible for this is it those who resist the measure or those who causelessly brought it forward and pressed it through having reason to know and in fact knowing it must and would be so resisted it could not but be expected by its author that it would be looked upon as a measure for the extension of slavery aggravated by a gross breach of faith argue as you will and long as you will this is the naked front and aspect of the measure and in this aspect it could not but produce agitation slavery is founded in the selfishness of man s nature opposition to it is his love of justice these principles are an eternal antagonism and when brought into collision so fiercely as slavery extension brings them shocks and throes and convulsions must ceaselessly follow repeal the missouri compromise repeal all compromises repeal the declaration of independence repeal all past history you still can not repeal human nature it still will be the abundance of man s heart that slavery extension is wrong and out of the abundance of his heart his mouth will continue to speak the structure too of the nebraska bill is very peculiar the people are to decide the question of slavery for themselves but when they are to decide or how they are to decide or whether when the question is once decided it is to remain so or is it to be subject to an indefinite succession of new trials the law does not say is it to be decided by the first dozen settlers who arrive there or is it to await the arrival of a hundred is it to be decided by a vote of the people or a vote of the legislature or indeed by a vote of any sort to these questions the law gives no answer there is a mystery about this for when a member proposed to give the legislature express authority to exclude slavery it was hooted down by the friends of the bill this fact is worth remembering some yankees in the east are sending emigrants to nebraska to exclude slavery from it and so far as i can judge they expect the question to be decided by voting in some way or other but the missourians are awake too they are within a stone s throw of the contested ground they hold meetings and pass resolutions in which not the slightest allusion to voting is made they resolve that slavery already exists in the territory that more shall go there that they remaining in missouri will protect it and that abolitionists shall be hung or driven away through all this bowie knives and six shooters are seen plainly enough but never a glimpse of the ballot box and really what is to be the result of this each party within having numerous and determined backers without is it not probable that the contest will come to blows and bloodshed could there be a more apt invention to bring about collision and violence on the slavery question than this nebraska project is i do not charge or believe that such was intended by congress but if they had literally formed a ring and placed champions within it to fight out the controversy the fight could be no more likely to come off than it is and if this fight should begin is it likely to take a very peaceful union saving turn will not the first drop of blood so shed be the real knell of the union the missouri compromise ought to be restored for the sake of the union it ought to be restored we ought to elect a house of representatives which will vote its restoration if by any means we omit to do this what follows slavery may or may not be established in nebraska but whether it be or not we shall have repudiated discarded from the councils of the nation the spirit of compromise for who after this will ever trust in a national compromise the spirit of mutual concession that spirit which first gave us the constitution and which has thrice saved the union we shall have strangled and cast from us forever and what shall we have in lieu of it the south flushed with triumph and tempted to excesses the north betrayed as they believe brooding on wrong and burning for revenge one side will provoke the other resent the one will taunt the other defy one agrees the other retaliates already a few in the north defy all constitutional restraints resist the execution of the fugitive slave law and even menace the institution of slavery in the states where it exists already a few in the south claim the constitutional right to take to and hold slaves in the free states demand the revival of the slave trade and demand a treaty with great britain by which fugitive slaves may be reclaimed from canada as yet they are but few on either side it is a grave question for the lovers of the union whether the final destruction of the missouri compromise and with it the spirit of all compromise will or will not embolden and embitter each of these and fatally increase the numbers of both but restore the compromise and what then we thereby restore the national faith the national confidence the national feeling of brotherhood we thereby reinstate the spirit of concession and compromise that spirit which has never failed us in past perils and which may be safely trusted for all the future the south ought to join in doing this the peace of the nation is as dear to them as to us in memories of the past and hopes of the future they share as largely as we it would be on their part a great act great in its spirit and great in its effect it would be worth to the nation a hundred years purchase of peace and prosperity and what of sacrifice would they make they only surrender to us what they gave us for a consideration long long ago what they have not now asked for struggled or cared for what has been thrust upon them not less to their own astonishment than to ours but it is said we cannot restore it that though we elect every member of the lower house the senate is still against us it is quite true that of the senators who passed the nebraska bill a majority of the whole senate will retain their seats in spite of the elections of this and the next year but if at these elections their several constituencies shall clearly express their will against nebraska will these senators disregard their will will they neither obey nor make room for those who will but even if we fail to technically restore the compromise it is still a great point to carry a popular vote in favor of the restoration the moral weight of such a vote can not be estimated too highly the authors of nebraska are not at all satisfied with the destruction of the compromise an endorsement of this principle they proclaim to be the great object with them nebraska alone is a small matter to establish a principle for future use is what they particularly desire that future use is to be the planting of slavery wherever in the wide world local and unorganized opposition can not prevent it now if you wish to give them this endorsement if you wish to establish this principle do so i shall regret it but it is your right on the contrary if you are opposed to the principle intend to give it no such endorsement let no wheedling no sophistry divert you from throwing a direct vote against it some men mostly whigs who condemn the repeal of the missouri compromise nevertheless hesitate to go for its restoration lest they be thrown in company with the abolitionist will they allow me as an old whig to tell them good humoredly that i think this is very silly stand with anybody that stands right stand with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong stand with the abolitionist in restoring the missouri compromise and stand against him when he attempts to repeal the fugitive slave law in the latter case you stand with the southern disunionist what of that you are still right in both cases you are right in both cases you oppose the dangerous extremes in both you stand on middle ground and hold the ship level and steady in both you are national and nothing less than national this is good old whig ground to desert such ground because of any company is to be less than a whig less than a man less than an american i particularly object to the new position which the avowed principle of this nebraska law gives to slavery in the body politic i object to it because it assumes that there can be moral right in the enslaving of one man by another i object to it as a dangerous dalliance for a few people a sad evidence that feeling prosperity we forget right that liberty as a principle we have ceased to revere i object to it because the fathers of the republic eschewed and rejected it the argument of necessity was the only argument they ever admitted in favor of slavery and so far and so far only as it carried them did they ever go they found the institution existing among us which they could not help and they cast blame upon the british king for having permitted its introduction before the constitution they prohibited its introduction into the north western territory the only country we owned then free from it at the framing and adoption of the constitution they forbore to so much as mention the word slave or slavery in the whole instrument in the provision for the recovery of fugitives the slave is spoken of as a person held to service or labor in that prohibiting the abolition of the african slave trade for twenty years that trade is spoken of as the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit c these are the only provisions alluding to slavery thus the thing is hid away in the constitution just as an afflicted man hides away a wen or a cancer which he dares not cut out at once lest he bleed to death with the promise nevertheless that the cutting may begin at the end of a given time less than this our fathers could not do and now they would not do necessity drove them so far and farther they would not go but this is not all the earliest congress under the constitution took the same view of slavery they hedged and hemmed it in to the narrowest limits of necessity in 1794 they prohibited an out going slave trade that is the taking of slaves from the united states to sell in 1798 they prohibited the bringing of slaves from africa into the mississippi territory this territory then comprising what are now the states of mississippi and alabama this was ten years before they had the authority to do the same thing as to the states existing at the adoption of the constitution in 1800 they prohibited american citizens from trading in slaves between foreign countries as for instance from africa to brazil in 1803 they passed a law in aid of one or two state laws in restraint of the internal slave trade in 1807 in apparent hot haste they passed the law nearly a year in advance to take effect the first day of 1808 the very first day the constitution would permit prohibiting the african slave trade by heavy pecuniary and corporal penalties in 1820 finding these provisions ineffectual they declared the trade piracy and annexed to it the extreme penalty of death while all this was passing in the general government five or six of the original slave states had adopted systems of gradual emancipation and by which the institution was rapidly becoming extinct within these limits thus we see the plain unmistakable spirit of that age towards slavery was hostility to the principle and toleration only by necessity but now it is to be transformed into a sacred right nebraska brings it forth places it on the high road to extension and perpetuity and with a pat on its back says to it go and god speed you henceforth it is to be the chief jewel of the nation the very figure head of the ship of state little by little but steadily as man s march to the grave we have been giving up the old for the new faith near eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration that for some men to enslave others is a sacred right of self government these principles can not stand together they are as opposite as god and mammon and whoever holds to the one must despise the other when pettit in connection with his support of the nebraska bill called the declaration of independence a self evident lie he only did what consistency and candor require all other nebraska men to do of the forty odd nebraska senators who sat present and heard him no one rebuked him nor am i apprized that any nebraska newspaper or any nebraska orator in the whole nation has ever yet rebuked him if this had been said among marion s men southerners though they were what would have become of the man who said it if this had been said to the men who captured andre the man who said it would probably have been hung sooner than andre was if it had been said in old independence hall seventy eight years ago the very door keeper would have throttled the man and thrust him into the street let no one be deceived the spirit of seventy six and the spirit of nebraska are utter antagonisms and the former is being rapidly displaced by the latter fellow countrymen americans south as well as north shall we make no effort to arrest this already the liberal party throughout the world express the apprehension that the one retrograde institution in america is undermining the principles of progress and fatally violating the noblest political system the world ever saw this is not the taunt of enemies but the warning of friends is it quite safe to disregard it to despise it is there no danger to liberty itself in discarding the earliest practice and first precept of our ancient faith in our greedy chase to make profit of the negro let us beware lest we cancel and tear to pieces even the white man s charter of freedom our republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust let us repurify it let us turn and wash it white in the spirit if not the blood of the revolution let us turn slavery from its claims of moral right back upon its existing legal rights and its arguments of necessity let us return it to the position our fathers gave it and there let it rest in peace let us re adopt the declaration of independence and with it the practices and policy which harmonize with it let north and south let all americans let all lovers of liberty everywhere join in the great and good work if we do this we shall not only have saved the union but we shall have so saved it as to make and to keep it forever worthy of the saving we shall have so saved it that the succeeding millions of free happy people the world over shall rise up and call us blessed to the latest generations at springfield twelve days ago where i had spoken substantially as i have here judge douglas replied to me and as he is to reply to me here i shall attempt to anticipate him by noticing some of the points he made there he commenced by stating i had assumed all the way through that the principle of the nebraska bill would have the effect of extending slavery he denied that this was intended or that this effect would follow i will not re open the argument upon this point that such was the intention the world believed at the start and will continue to believe this was the countenance of the thing and both friends and enemies instantly recognized it as such that countenance can not now be changed by argument you can as easily argue the color out of the negroes skin like the bloody hand you may wash it and wash it the red witness of guilt still sticks and stares horribly at you next he says congressional intervention never prevented slavery any where that it did not prevent it in the north west territory now in illinois that in fact illinois came into the union as a slave state that the principle of the nebraska bill expelled it from illinois from several old states from every where now this is mere quibbling all the way through if the ordinance of 87 did not keep slavery out of the north west territory how happens it that the north west shore of the ohio river is entirely free from it while the south east shore less than a mile distant along nearly the whole length of the river is entirely covered with it if that ordinance did not keep it out of illinois what was it that made the difference between illinois and missouri they lie side by side the mississippi river only dividing them while their early settlements were within the same latitude between 1810 and 1820 the number of slaves in missouri increased 7 211 while in illinois in the same ten years they decreased 51 this appears by the census returns during nearly all of that ten years both were territories not states during this time the ordinance forbid slavery to go into illinois and nothing forbid it to go into missouri it did go into missouri and did not go into illinois that is the fact can any one doubt as to the reason of it but he says illinois came into the union as a slave state silence perhaps would be the best answer to this flat contradiction of the known history of the country what are the facts upon which this bold assertion is based when we first acquired the country as far back as 1787 there were some slaves within it held by the french inhabitants at kaskaskia the territorial legislation admitted a few negroes from the slave states as indentured servants one year after the adoption of the first state constitution the whole number of them was what do you think just 117 while the aggregate free population was 55 094 about 470 to one upon this state of facts the people framed their constitution prohibiting the further introduction of slavery with a sort of guaranty to the owners of the few indentured servants giving freedom to their children to be born thereafter and making no mention whatever of any supposed slave for life out of this small matter the judge manufactures his argument that illinois came into the union as a slave state let the facts be the answer to the argument the principles of the nebraska bill he says expelled slavery from illinois the principle of that bill first planted it here that is it first came because there was no law to prevent it first came before we owned the country and finding it here and having the ordinance of 87 to prevent its increasing our people struggled along and finally got rid of it as best they could but the principle of the nebraska bill abolished slavery in several of the old states well it is true that several of the old states in the last quarter of the last century did adopt systems of gradual emancipation by which the institution has finally become extinct within their limits but it may or may not be true that the principle of the nebraska bill was the cause that led to the adoption of these measures it is now more than fifty years since the last of these states adopted its system of emancipation if nebraska bill is the real author of these benevolent works it is rather deplorable that he has for so long a time ceased working all together is there not some reason to suspect that it was the principle of the revolution and not the principle of nebraska bill that led to emancipation in these old states leave it to the people of those old emancipating states and i am quite sure they will decide that neither that nor any other good thing ever did or ever will come of nebraska bill in the course of my main argument judge douglas interrupted me to say that the principle the nebraska bill was very old that it originated when god made man and placed good and evil before him allowing him to choose for himself being responsible for the choice he should make at the time i thought this was merely playful and i answered it accordingly but in his reply to me he renewed it as a serious argument in seriousness then the facts of this proposition are not true as stated god did not place good and evil before man telling him to make his choice on the contrary he did tell him there was one tree of the fruit of which he should not eat upon pain of certain death i should scarcely wish so strong a prohibition against slavery in nebraska but this argument strikes me as not a little remarkable in another particular in its strong resemblance to the old argument for the divine right of kings by the latter the king is to do just as he pleases with his white subjects being responsible to god alone by the former the white man is to do just as he pleases with his black slaves being responsible to god alone the two things are precisely alike and it is but natural that they should find similar arguments to sustain them i had argued that the application of the principle of self government as contended for would require the revival of the african slave trade that no argument could be made in favor of a man s right to take slaves to nebraska which could not be equally well made in favor of his right to bring them from the coast of africa the judge replied that the constitution requires the suppression of the foreign slave trade but does not require the prohibition of slavery in the territories that is a mistake in point of fact the constitution does not require the action of congress in either case and it does authorize it in both and so there is still no difference between the cases in regard to what i had said the advantage the slave states have over the free in the matter of representation the judge replied that we in the free states count five free negroes as five white people while in the slave states they count five slaves as three whites only and that the advantage at last was on the side of the free states now in the slave states they count free negroes just as we do and it so happens that besides their slaves they have as many free negroes as we have and thirty three thousand over thus their free negroes more than balance ours and their advantage over us in consequence of their slaves still remains as i stated it in reply to my argument that the compromise measures of 1850 were a system of equivalents and that the provisions of no one of them could fairly be carried to other subjects without its corresponding equivalent being carried with it the judge denied out right that these measures had any connection with or dependence upon each other this is mere desperation if they have no connection why are they always spoken of in connection why has he so spoken of them a thousand times why has he constantly called them a series of measures why does everybody call them a compromise why was california kept out of the union six or seven months if it was not because of its connection with the other measures webster s leading definition of the verb to compromise is to adjust and settle a difference by mutual agreement with concessions of claims by the parties this conveys precisely the popular understanding of the word compromise we knew before the judge told us that these measures passed separately and in distinct bills and that no two of them were passed by the votes of precisely the same members but we also know and so does he know that no one of them could have passed both branches of congress but for the understanding that the others were to pass also upon this understanding each got votes which it could have got in no other way it is this fact that gives to the measures their true character and it is the universal knowledge of this fact that has given them the name of compromise so expressive of that true character i had asked if in carrying the provisions of the utah and new mexico laws to nebraska you could clear away other objection how can you leave nebraska perfectly free to introduce slavery before she forms a constitution during her territorial government while the utah and new mexico laws only authorize it when they form constitutions and are admitted into the union to this judge douglas answered that the utah and new mexico laws also authorized it before and to prove this he read from one of their laws as follows that the legislative power of said territory shall extend to all rightful subjects of legislation consistent with the constitution of the united states and the provisions of this act now it is perceived from the reading of this that there is nothing express upon the subject but that the authority is sought to be implied merely for the general provision of all rightful subjects of legislation in reply to this i insist as a legal rule of construction as well as the plain popular view of the matter that the express provision for utah and new mexico coming in with slavery if they choose when they shall form constitutions is an exclusion of all implied authority on the same subject that congress having the subject distinctly in their minds when they made the express provision they therein expressed their whole meaning on that subject the judge rather insinuated that i had found it convenient to forget the washington territorial law passed in 1853 this was a division of oregon organizing the northern part as the territory of washington he asserted that by this act the ordinance of 87 theretofore existing in oregon was repealed that nearly all the members of congress voted for it beginning in the h r with charles allen of massachusetts and ending with richard yates of illinois and that he could not understand how those who now oppose the nebraska bill so voted then unless it was because it was then too soon after both the great political parties had ratified the compromises of 1850 and the ratification therefore too fresh to be then repudiated now i had seen the washington act before and i have carefully examined it since and i aver that there is no repeal of the ordinance of 87 or of any prohibition of slavery in it in express terms there is absolutely nothing in the whole law upon the subject in fact nothing to lead a reader to think of the subject to my judgment it is equally free from every thing from which such repeal can be legally implied but however this may be are men now to be entrapped by a legal implication extracted from covert language introduced perhaps for the very purpose of entrapping them i sincerely wish every man could read this law quite through carefully watching every sentence and every line for a repeal of the ordinance of 87 or any thing equivalent to it another point on the washington act if it was intended to be modelled after the utah and new mexico acts as judge douglas insists why was it not inserted in it as in them that washington was to come in with or without slavery as she may choose at the adoption of her constitution it has no such provision in it and i defy the ingenuity of man to give a reason for the omission other than that it was not intended to follow the utah and new mexico laws in regard to the question of slavery the washington act not only differs vitally from the utah and new mexico acts but the nebraska act differs vitally from both by the latter act the people are left perfectly free to regulate their own domestic concerns c but in all the former all their laws are to be submitted to congress and if disapproved are to be null the washington act goes even further it absolutely prohibits the territorial legislation by very strong and guarded language from establishing banks or borrowing money on the faith of the territory is this the sacred right of self government we hear vaunted so much no sir the nebraska bill finds no model in the acts of 50 or the washington act it finds no model in any law from adam till today as phillips says of napoleon the nebraska act is grand gloomy and peculiar wrapped in the solitude of its own originality without a model and without a shadow upon the earth in the course of his reply senator douglas remarked in substance that he had always considered this government was made for the white people and not for the negroes why in point of mere fact i think so too but in this remark of the judge there is a significance which i think is the key to the great mistake if there is any such mistake which he has made in this nebraska measure it shows that the judge has no very vivid impression that the negro is a human and consequently has no idea that there can be any moral question in legislating about him in his view the question of whether a new country shall be slave or free is a matter of as utter indifference as it is whether his neighbor shall plant his farm with tobacco or stock it with horned cattle now whether this view is right or wrong it is very certain that the great mass of mankind take a totally different view they consider slavery a great moral wrong and their feelings against it is not evanescent but eternal it lies at the very foundation of their sense of justice and it cannot be trifled with it is a great and durable element of popular action and i think no statesman can safely disregard it our senator also objects that those who oppose him in this measure do not entirely agree with one another he reminds me that in my firm adherence to the constitutional rights of the slave states i differ widely from others who are co operating with me in opposing the nebraska bill and he says it is not quite fair to oppose him in this variety of ways he should remember that he took us by surprise astounded us by this measure we were thunderstruck and stunned and we reeled and fell in utter confusion but we rose each fighting grasping whatever he could first reach a scythe a pitchfork a chopping axe or a butcher s cleaver we struck in the direction of the sound and we are rapidly closing in upon him he must not think to divert us from our purpose by showing us that our drill our dress and our weapons are not entirely perfect and uniform when the storm shall be past he shall find us still americans no less devoted to the continued union and prosperity of the country than heretofore finally the judge invokes against me the memory of clay and of webster they were great men and men of great deeds but where have i assailed them for what is it that their life long enemy shall now make profit by assuming to defend them against me their life long friend i go against the repeal of the missouri compromise did they ever go for it they went for the compromise of 1850 did i ever go against them they were greatly devoted to the union to the small measure of my ability was i ever less so clay and webster were dead before this question arose by what authority shall our senator say they would espouse his side of it if alive mr clay was the leading spirit in making the missouri compromise is it very credible that if now alive he would take the lead in the breaking of it the truth is that some support from whigs is now a necessity with the judge and for thus it is that the names of clay and webster are now invoked his old friends have deserted him in such numbers as to leave too few to live by he came to his own and his own received him not and lo he turns unto the gentiles a word now as to the judge s desperate assumption that the compromises of 50 had no connection with one another that illinois came into the union as a slave state and some other similar ones this is no other than a bold denial of the history of the country if we do not know that the compromises of 50 were dependent on each other if we do not know that illinois came into the union as a free state we do not know any thing if we do not know these things we do not know that we ever had a revolutionary war or such a chief as washington to deny these things is to deny our national axioms or dogmas at least and it puts an end to all argument if a man will stand up and assert and repeat and re assert that two and two do not make four i know nothing in the power of argument that can stop him i think i can answer the judge so long as he sticks to the premises but when he flies from them i can not work an argument into the consistency of a maternal gag and actually close his mouth with it in such a case i can only commend him to the seventy thousand answers just in from pennsylvania ohio and indiana the repeal of the missouri compromise and the propriety of its restoration constitute the subject of what i am about to say as i desire to present my own connected view of this subject my remarks will not be specifically an answer to judge douglas yet as i proceed the main points he has presented will arise and will receive such respectful attention as i may be able to give them i wish further to say that i do not propose to question the patriotism or to assail the motives of any man or class of men but rather to strictly confine myself to the naked merits of the question i also wish to be no less than national in all the positions i may take and whenever i take ground which others have thought or may think narrow sectional and dangerous to the union i hope to give a reason which will appear sufficient at least to some why i think differently and as this subject is no other than part and parcel of the larger general question of domestic slavery i wish to make and to keep the distinction between the existing institution and the extension of it so broad and so clear that no honest man can misunderstand me and no dishonest one successfully misrepresent me in order to a clear understanding of what the missouri compromise is a short history of the preceding kindred subjects will perhaps be proper when we established our independence we did not own or claim the country to which this compromise applies indeed strictly speaking the confederacy then owned no country at all the states respectively owned the country within their limits and some of them owned territory beyond their strict state limits virginia thus owned the north western territory the country out of which the principal part of ohio all indiana all illinois all michigan and all wisconsin have since been formed she also owned perhaps within her then limits what has since been formed into the state of kentucky north carolina thus owned what is now the state of tennessee and south carolina and georgia in separate parts owned what are now mississippi and alabama connecticut i think owned the little remaining part of ohio being the same where they now send giddings to congress and beat all creation at making cheese these territories together with the states themselves constituted all the country over which the confederacy then claimed any sort of jurisdiction we were then living under the articles of confederation which were superceded by the constitution several years afterwards the question of ceding these territories to the general government was set on foot mr jefferson the author of the declaration of independence and otherwise a chief actor in the revolution then a delegate in congress afterwards twice president who was is and perhaps will continue to be the most distinguished politician of our history a virginian by birth and continued residence and withal a slave holder conceived the idea of taking that occasion to prevent slavery ever going into the north western territory he prevailed on the virginia legislature to adopt his views and to cede the territory making the prohibition of slavery therein a condition of the deed congress accepted the cession with the condition and in the first ordinance which the acts of congress were then called for the government of the territory provided that slavery should never be permitted therein this is the famed ordinance of 87 so often spoken of thenceforward for sixty one years and until in 1848 the last scrap of this territory came into the union as the state of wisconsin all parties acted in quiet obedience to this ordinance it is now what jefferson foresaw and intended the happy home of teeming millions of free white prosperous people and no slave amongst them thus with the author of the declaration of independence the policy of prohibiting slavery in new territory originated thus away back of the constitution in the pure fresh free breath of the revolution the state of virginia and the national congress put that policy in practice thus through sixty odd of the best years of the republic did that policy steadily work to its great and beneficent end and thus in those five states and five millions of free enterprising people we have before us the rich fruits of this policy but now new light breaks upon us now congress declares this ought never to have been and the like of it must never be again the sacred right of self government is grossly violated by it we even find some men who drew their first breath and every other breath of their lives under this very restriction now live in dread of absolute suffocation if they should be restricted in the sacred right of taking slaves to nebraska that perfect liberty they sigh for the liberty of making slaves of other people jefferson never thought of their own father never thought of they never thought of themselves a year ago how fortunate for them they did not sooner become sensible of their great misery oh how difficult it is to treat with respect such assaults upon all we have ever really held sacred but to return to history in 1803 we purchased what was then called louisiana of france it included the now states of louisiana arkansas missouri and iowa also the territory of minnesota and the present bone of contention kansas and nebraska slavery already existed among the french at new orleans and to some extent at st louis in 1812 louisiana came into the union as a slave state without controversy in 1818 or 19 missouri showed signs of a wish to come in with slavery this was resisted by northern members of congress and thus began the first great slavery agitation in the nation this controversy lasted several months and became very angry and exciting the house of representatives voting steadily for the prohibition of slavery in missouri and the senate voting as steadily against it threats of breaking up the union were freely made and the ablest public men of the day became seriously alarmed at length a compromise was made in which like all compromises both sides yielded something it was a law passed on the 6th day of march 1820 providing that missouri might come into the union with slavery but that in all the remaining part of the territory purchased of france which lies north of 36 degrees and 30 minutes north latitude slavery should never be permitted this provision of law is the missouri compromise in excluding slavery north of the line the same language is employed as in the ordinance of 87 it directly applied to iowa minnesota and to the present bone of contention kansas and nebraska whether there should or should not be slavery south of that line nothing was said in the law but arkansas constituted the principal remaining part south of the line and it has since been admitted as a slave state without serious controversy more recently iowa north of the line came in as a free state without controversy still later minnesota north of the line had a territorial organization without controversy texas principally south of the line and west of arkansas though originally within the purchase from france had in 1819 been traded off to spain in our treaty for the acquisition of florida it had thus become a part of mexico mexico revolutionized and became independent of spain american citizens began settling rapidly with their slaves in the southern part of texas soon they revolutionized against mexico and established an independent government of their own adopting a constitution with slavery strongly resembling the constitutions of our slave states by still another rapid move texas claiming a boundary much further west than when we parted with her in 1819 was brought back to the united states and admitted into the union as a slave state there then was little or no settlement in the northern part of texas a considerable portion of which lay north of the missouri line and in the resolutions admitting her into the union the missouri restriction was expressly extended westward across her territory this was in 1845 only nine years ago thus originated the missouri compromise and thus has it been respected down to 1845 and even four years later in 1849 our distinguished senator in a public address held the following language in relation to it the missouri compromise had been in practical operation for about a quarter of a century and had received the sanction and approbation of men of all parties in every section of the union it had allayed all sectional jealousies and irritations growing out of this vexed question and harmonized and tranquilized the whole country it had given to henry clay as its prominent champion the proud sobriquet of the great pacificator and by that title and for that service his political friends had repeatedly appealed to the people to rally under his standard as a presidential candidate as the man who had exhibited the patriotism and the power to suppress an unholy and treasonable agitation and preserve the union he was not aware that any man or any party from any section of the union had ever urged as an objection to mr clay that he was the great champion of the missouri compromise on the contrary the effort was made by the opponents of mr clay to prove that he was not entitled to the exclusive merit of that great patriotic measure and that the honor was equally due to others as well as to him for securing its adoption that it had its origin in the hearts of all patriotic men who desired to preserve and perpetuate the blessings of our glorious union an origin akin that of the constitution of the united states conceived in the same spirit of fraternal affection and calculated to remove forever the only danger which seemed to threaten at some distant day to sever the social bond of union all the evidences of public opinion at that day seemed to indicate that this compromise had been canonized in the hearts of the american people as a sacred thing which no ruthless hand would ever be reckless enough to disturb i do not read this extract to involve judge douglas in an inconsistency if he afterwards thought he had been wrong it was right for him to change i bring this forward merely to show the high estimate placed on the missouri compromise by all parties up to so late as the year 1849 but going back a little in point of time our war with mexico broke out in 1846 when congress was about adjourning that session president polk asked them to place two millions of dollars under his control to be used by him in the recess if found practicable and expedient in negociating a treaty of peace with mexico and acquiring some part of her territory a bill was duly got up for the purpose and was progressing swimmingly in the house of representatives when a member by the name of david wilmot a democrat from pennsylvania moved as an amendment provided that in any territory thus acquired there shall never be slavery this is the origin of the far famed wilmot proviso it created a great flutter but it stuck like wax was voted into the bill and the bill passed with it through the house the senate however adjourned without final action on it and so both appropriation and proviso were lost for the time the war continued and at the next session the president renewed his request for the appropriation enlarging the amount i think to three million again came the proviso and defeated the measure congress adjourned again and the war went on in dec 1847 the new congress assembled i was in the lower house that term the wilmot proviso or the principle of it was constantly coming up in some shape or other and i think i may venture to say i voted for it at least forty times during the short term i was there the senate however held it in check and it never became law in the spring of 1848 a treaty of peace was made with mexico by which we obtained that portion of her country which now constitutes the territories of new mexico and utah and the now state of california by this treaty the wilmot proviso was defeated as so far as it was intended to be a condition of the acquisition of territory its friends however were still determined to find some way to restrain slavery from getting into the new country this new acquisition lay directly west of our old purchase from france and extended west to the pacific ocean and was so situated that if the missouri line should be extended straight west the new country would be divided by such extended line leaving some north and some south of it on judge douglas motion a bill or provision of a bill passed the senate to so extend the missouri line the proviso men in the house including myself voted it down because by implication it gave up the southern part to slavery while we were bent on having it all free in the fall of 1848 the gold mines were discovered in california this attracted people to it with unprecedented rapidity so that on or soon after the meeting of the new congress in dec 1849 she already had a population of nearly a hundred thousand had called a convention formed a state constitution excluding slavery and was knocking for admission into the union the proviso men of course were for letting her in but the senate always true to the other side would not consent to her admission and there california stood kept out of the union because she would not let slavery into her borders under all the circumstances perhaps this was not wrong there were other points of dispute connected with the general question of slavery which equally needed adjustment the south clamored for a more efficient fugitive slave law the north clamored for the abolition of a peculiar species of slave trade in the district of columbia in connection with which in view from the windows of the capitol a sort of negro livery stable where droves of negroes were collected temporarily kept and finally taken to southern markets precisely like droves of horses had been openly maintained for fifty years utah and new mexico needed territorial governments and whether slavery should or should not be prohibited within them was another question the indefinite western boundary of texas was to be settled she was received a slave state and consequently the farther west the slavery men could push her boundary the more slave country they secured and the farther east the slavery opponents could thrust the boundary back the less slave ground was secured thus this was just as clearly a slavery question as any of the others these points all needed adjustment and they were all held up perhaps wisely to make them help to adjust one another the union now as in 1820 was thought to be in danger and devotion to the union rightfully inclined men to yield somewhat in points where nothing else could have so inclined them a compromise was finally effected the south got their new fugitive slave law and the north got california the far best part of our acquisition from mexico as a free state the south got a provision that new mexico and utah when admitted as states may come in with or without slavery as they may then choose and the north got the slave trade abolished in the district of columbia the north got the western boundary of texas thence further back eastward than the south desired but in turn they gave texas ten millions of dollars with which to pay her old debts this is the compromise of 1850 preceding the presidential election of 1852 each of the great political parties democrats and whigs met in convention and adopted resolutions endorsing the compromise of 50 as a finality a final settlement so far as these parties could make it so of all slavery agitation previous to this in 1851 the illinois legislature had indorsed it during this long period of time nebraska had remained substantially an uninhabited country but now emigration to and settlement within it began to take place it is about one third as large as the present united states and its importance so long overlooked begins to come into view the restriction of slavery by the missouri compromise directly applies to it in fact was first made and has since been maintained expressly for it in 1853 a bill to give it a territorial government passed the house of representatives and in the hands of judge douglas failed of passing the senate only for want of time this bill contained no repeal of the missouri compromise indeed when it was assailed because it did not contain such repeal judge douglas defended it in its existing form on january 4th 1854 judge douglas introduces a new bill to give nebraska territorial government he accompanies this bill with a report in which last he expressly recommends that the missouri compromise shall neither be affirmed nor repealed before long the bill is so modified as to make two territories instead of one calling the southern one kansas also about a month after the introduction of the bill on the judge s own motion it is so amended as to declare the missouri compromise inoperative and void and substantially that the people who go and settle there may establish slavery or exclude it as they may see fit in this shape the bill passed both branches of congress and became a law this is the repeal of the missouri compromise the foregoing history may not be precisely accurate in every particular but i am sure it is sufficiently so for all the uses i shall attempt to make of it and in it we have before us the chief material enabling us to correctly judge whether the repeal of the missouri compromise is right or wrong i think and shall try to show that it is wrong wrong in its direct effect letting slavery into kansas and nebraska and wrong in its prospective principle allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world where men can be found inclined to take it this declared indifference but as i must think covert real zeal for the spread of slavery i can not but hate i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world enables the enemies of free institutions with plausibility to taunt us as hypocrites causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity and especially because it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty criticising the declaration of independence and insisting that there is no right principle of action but self interest before proceeding let me say i think i have no prejudice against the southern people they are just what we would be in their situation if slavery did not now exist amongst them they would not introduce it if it did now exist amongst us we should not instantly give it up this i believe of the masses north and south doubtless there are individuals on both sides who would not hold slaves under any circumstances and others who would gladly introduce slavery anew if it were out of existence we know that some southern men do free their slaves go north and become tip top abolitionists while some northern ones go south and become most cruel slave masters when southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we i acknowledge the fact when it is said that the institution exists and that it is very difficult to get rid of it in any satisfactory way i can understand and appreciate the saying i surely will not blame them for not doing what i should not know how to do myself if all earthly power were given me i should not know what to do as to the existing institution my first impulse would be to free all the slaves and send them to liberia to their own native land but a moment s reflection would convince me that whatever of high hope as i think there is there may be in this in the long run its sudden execution is impossible if they were all landed there in a day they would all perish in the next ten days and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough in the world to carry them there in many times ten days what then free them all and keep them among us as underlings is it quite certain that this betters their condition i think i would not hold one in slavery at any rate yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce people upon what next free them and make them politically and socially our equals my own feelings will not admit of this and if mine would we well know that those of the great mass of white people will not whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment is not the sole question if indeed it is any part of it a universal feeling whether well or ill founded can not be safely disregarded we can not then make them equals it does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted but for their tardiness in this i will not undertake to judge our brethren of the south when they remind us of their constitutional rights i acknowledge them not grudgingly but fully and fairly and i would give them any legislation for the reclaiming of their fugitives which should not in its stringency be more likely to carry a free man into slavery than our ordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one but all this to my judgment furnishes no more excuse for permitting slavery to go into our own free territory than it would for reviving the african slave trade by law the law which forbids the bringing of slaves from africa and that which has so long forbid the taking them to nebraska can hardly be distinguished on any moral principle and the repeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuses as that of the latter the arguments by which the repeal of the missouri compromise is sought to be justified are these first that the nebraska country needed a territorial government second that in various ways the public had repudiated it and demanded the repeal and therefore should not now complain of it and lastly that the repeal establishes a principle which is intrinsically right i will attempt an answer to each of them in its turn first then if that country was in need of a territorial organization could it not have had it as well without as with the repeal iowa and minnesota to both of which the missouri restriction applied had without its repeal each in succession territorial organizations and even the year before a bill for nebraska itself was within an ace of passing without the repealing clause and this in the hands of the same men who are now the champions of repeal why no necessity then for the repeal but still later when this very bill was first brought in it contained no repeal but say they because the public had demanded or rather commanded the repeal the repeal was to accompany the organization whenever that should occur now i deny that the public ever demanded any such thing ever repudiated the missouri compromise ever commanded its repeal i deny it and call for the proof it is not contended i believe that any such command has ever been given in express terms it is only said that it was done in principle the support of the wilmot proviso is the first fact mentioned to prove that the missouri restriction was repudiated in principle and the second is the refusal to extend the missouri line over the country acquired from mexico these are near enough alike to be treated together the one was to exclude the chances of slavery from the whole new acquisition by the lump and the other was to reject a division of it by which one half was to be given up to those chances now whether this was a repudiation of the missouri line in principle depends upon whether the missouri law contained any principle requiring the line to be extended over the country acquired from mexico i contend it did not i insist that it contained no general principle but that it was in every sense specific that its terms limit it to the country purchased from france is undenied and undeniable it could have no principle beyond the intention of those who made it they did not intend to extend the line to country which they did not own if they intended to extend it in the event of acquiring additional territory why did they not say so it was just as easy to say that in all the country west of the mississippi which we now own or may hereafter acquire there shall never be slavery as to say what they did say and they would have said it if they had meant it an intention to extend the law is not only not mentioned in the law but is not mentioned in any contemporaneous history both the law itself and the history of the times are a blank as to any principle of extension and by neither the known rules for construing statutes and contracts nor by common sense can any such principle be inferred another fact showing the specific character of the missouri law showing that it intended no more than it expressed showing that the line was not intended as a universal dividing line between free and slave territory present and prospective north of which slavery could never go is the fact that by that very law missouri came in as a slave state north of the line if that law contained any prospective principle the whole law must be looked to in order to ascertain what the principle was and by this rule the south could fairly contend that inasmuch as they got one slave state north of the line at the inception of the law they have the right to have another given them north of it occasionally now and then in the indefinite westward extension of the line this demonstrates the absurdity of attempting to deduce a prospective principle from the missouri compromise line when we voted for the wilmot proviso we were voting to keep slavery out of the whole missouri acquisition and little did we think we were thereby voting to let it into nebraska laying several hundred miles distant when we voted against extending the missouri line little did we think we were voting to destroy the old line then of near thirty years standing to argue that we thus repudiated the missouri compromise is no less absurd than it would be to argue that because we have so far forborne to acquire cuba we have thereby in principle repudiated our former acquisitions and determined to throw them out of the union no less absurd than it would be to say that because i may have refused to build an addition to my house i thereby have decided to destroy the existing house and if i catch you setting fire to my house you will turn upon me and say i instructed you to do it the most conclusive argument however that while voting for the wilmot proviso and while voting against the extension of the missouri line we never thought of disturbing the original missouri compromise is found in the facts that there was then and still is an unorganized tract of fine country nearly as large as the state of missouri lying immediately west of arkansas and south of the missouri compromise line and that we never attempted to prohibit slavery as to it i wish particular attention to this it adjoins the original missouri compromise line by its northern boundary and consequently is part of the country into which by implication slavery was permitted to go by that compromise there it has lain open ever since and there it still lies and yet no effort has been made at any time to wrest it from the south in all our struggles to prohibit slavery within our mexican acquisitions we never so much as lifted a finger to prohibit it as to this tract is not this entirely conclusive that at all times we have held the missouri compromise as a sacred thing even when against ourselves as well as when for us senator douglas sometimes says the missouri line itself was in principle only an extension of the line of the ordinance of 87 that is to say an extension of the ohio river i think this is weak enough on its face i will remark however that as a glance at the map will show the missouri line is a long way farther south than the ohio and that if our senator in proposing his extension had stuck to the principle of jogging southward perhaps it might not have been voted down so readily but next it is said that the compromises of 50 and the ratification of them by both political parties in 52 established a new principle which required the repeal of the missouri compromise this again i deny i deny it and demand the proof i have already stated fully what the compromises of 50 are the particular part of those measures for which the virtual repeal of the missouri compromise is sought to be inferred for it is admitted they contain nothing about it in express terms is the provision in the utah and new mexico laws which permits them when they seek admission into the union as states to come in with or without slavery as they shall then see fit now i insist this provision was made for utah and new mexico and for no other place whatever it had no more direct reference to nebraska than it had to the territories of the moon but say they it had reference to nebraska in principle let us see the north consented to this provision not because they considered it right in itself but because they were compensated paid for it they at the same time got california into the union as a free state this was far the best part of all they had struggled for by the wilmot proviso they also got the area of slavery somewhat narrowed in the settlement of the boundary of texas also they got the slave trade abolished in the district of columbia for all these desirable objects the north could afford to yield something and they did yield to the south the utah and new mexico provision i do not mean that the whole north or even a majority yielded when the law passed but enough yielded when added to the vote of the south to carry the measure now can it be pretended that the principle of this arrangement requires us to permit the same provision to be applied to nebraska without any equivalent at all give us another free state press the boundary of texas still further back give us another step toward the destruction of slavery in the district and you present us a similar case but ask us not to repeat for nothing what you paid for in the first instance if you wish the thing again pay again that is the principle of the compromises of 50 if indeed they had any principles beyond their specific terms it was the system of equivalents again if congress at that time intended that all future territories should when admitted as states come in with or without slavery at their own option why did it not say so with such an universal provision all know the bills could not have passed did they then could they establish a principle contrary to their own intention still further if they intended to establish the principle that wherever congress had control it should be left to the people to do as they thought fit with slavery why did they not authorize the people of the district of columbia at their adoption to abolish slavery within these limits i personally know that this has not been left undone because it was unthought of it was frequently spoken of by members of congress and by citizens of washington six years ago and i heard no one express a doubt that a system of gradual emancipation with compensation to owners would meet the approbation of a large majority of the white people of the district but without the action of congress they could say nothing and congress said no in the measures of 1850 congress had the subject of slavery in the district expressly in hand if they were then establishing the principle of allowing the people to do as they please with slavery why did they not apply the principle to that people again it is claimed that by the resolutions of the illinois legislature passed in 1851 the repeal of the missouri compromise was demanded this i deny also whatever may be worked out by a criticism of the language of those resolutions the people have never understood them as being any more than an endorsement of the compromises of 1850 and a release of our senators from voting for the wilmot proviso the whole people are living witnesses that this only was their view finally it is asked if we did not mean to apply the utah and new mexico provision to all future territories what did we mean when we in 1852 endorsed the compromises of 50 for myself i can answer this question most easily i meant not to ask a repeal or modification of the fugitive slave law i meant not to ask for the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia i meant not to resist the admission of utah and new mexico even should they ask to come in as slave states i meant nothing about additional territories because as i understood we then had no territory whose character as to slavery was not already settled as to nebraska i regarded its character as being fixed by the missouri compromise for thirty years as unalterably fixed as that of my own home in illinois as to new acquisitions i said sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof when we make new acquaintances we will as heretofore try to manage them some how that is my answer that is what i meant and said and i appeal to the people to say each for himself whether that was not also the universal meaning of the free states and now in turn let me ask a few questions if by any or all these matters the repeal of the missouri compromise was commanded why was not the command sooner obeyed why was the repeal omitted in the nebraska bill of 1853 why was it omitted in the original bill of 1854 why in the accompanying report was such a repeal characterized as a departure from the course pursued in 1850 and its continued omission recommended i am aware judge douglas now argues that the subsequent express repeal is no substantial alteration of the bill this argument seems wonderful to me it is as if one should argue that white and black are not different he admits however that there is a literal change in the bill and that he made the change in deference to other senators who would not support the bill without this proves that those other senators thought the change a substantial one and that the judge thought their opinions worth deferring to his own opinions therefore seem not to rest on a very firm basis even in his own mind and i suppose the world believes and will continue to believe that precisely on the substance of that change this whole agitation has arisen i conclude then that the public never demanded the repeal of the missouri compromise i now come to consider whether the repeal with its avowed principle is intrinsically right i insist that it is not take the particular case a controversy had arisen between the advocates and opponents of slavery in relation to its establishment within the country we had purchased of france the southern and then best part of the purchase was already in as a slave state the controversy was settled by also letting missouri in as a slave state but with the agreement that within all the remaining part of the purchase north of a certain line there should never be slavery as to what was to be done with the remaining part south of the line nothing was said but perhaps the fair implication was that it should come in with slavery if it should so choose the southern part except a portion heretofore mentioned afterwards did come in with slavery as the state of arkansas all these many years since 1820 the northern part had remained a wilderness at length settlements began in it also in due course iowa came in as a free state and minnesota was given a territorial government without removing the slavery restriction finally the sole remaining part north of the line kansas and nebraska was to be organized and it is proposed and carried to blot out the old dividing line of thirty four years standing and to open the whole of that country to the introduction of slavery now this to my mind is manifestly unjust after an angry and dangerous controversy the parties made friends by dividing the bone of contention the one party first appropriates her own share beyond all power to be disturbed in the possession of it and then seizes the share of the other party it is as if two starving men had divided their only loaf the one had hastily swallowed his half and then grabbed the other half just as he was putting it to his mouth let me here drop the main argument to notice what i consider rather an inferior matter it is argued that slavery will not go to kansas and nebraska in any event this is a palliation a lullaby i have some hope that it will not but let us not be too confident as to climate a glance at the map shows that there are five slave states delaware maryland virginia kentucky and missouri and also the district of columbia all north of the missouri compromise line the census returns of 1850 show that within these there are 867 276 slaves being more than one fourth of all the slaves in the nation it is not climate then that will keep slavery out of these territories is there any thing in the peculiar nature of the country missouri adjoins these territories by her entire western boundary and slavery is already within every one of her western counties i have even heard it said that there are more slaves in proportion to whites in the north western county of missouri than within any county of the state slavery pressed entirely up to the old western boundary of the state and when rather recently a part of that boundary at the north west was moved out a little farther west slavery followed on quite up to the new line now when the restriction is removed what is to prevent it from going still further climate will not no peculiarity of the country will nothing in nature will will the disposition of the people prevent it those nearest the scene are all in favor of the extension the yankees who are opposed to it may be more numerous but in military phrase the battle field is too far from their base of operations but it is said there now is no law in nebraska on the subject of slavery and that in such case taking a slave there operates his freedom that is good book law but is not the rule of actual practice wherever slavery is it has been first introduced without law the oldest laws we find concerning it are not laws introducing it but regulating it as an already existing thing a white man takes his slave to nebraska now who will inform the negro that he is free who will take him before court to test the question of his freedom in ignorance of his legal emancipation he is kept chopping splitting and plowing others are brought and move on in the same track at last if ever the time for voting comes on the question of slavery the institution already in fact exists in the country and cannot well be removed the facts of its presence and the difficulty of its removal will carry the vote in its favor keep it out until a vote is taken and a vote in favor of it can not be got in any population of forty thousand on earth who have been drawn together by the ordinary motives of emigration and settlement to get slaves into the country simultaneously with the whites in the incipient stages of settlement is the precise stake played for and won in this nebraska measure the question is asked us if slaves will go in notwithstanding the general principle of law liberates them why would they not equally go in against positive statute law go in even if the missouri restriction were maintained i answer because it takes a much bolder man to venture in with his property in the latter case than in the former because the positive congressional enactment is known to and respected by all or nearly all whereas the negative principle that no law is free law is not much known except among lawyers we have some experience of this practical difference in spite of the ordinance of 87 a few negroes were brought into illinois and held in a state of quasi slavery not enough however to carry a vote of the people in favor of the institution when they came to form a constitution but in the adjoining missouri country where there was no ordinance of 87 was no restriction they were carried ten times nay a hundred times as fast and actually made a slave state this is fact naked fact another lullaby argument is that taking slaves to new countries does not increase their number does not make any one slave who otherwise would be free there is some truth in this and i am glad of it but it not wholly true the african slave trade is not yet effectually suppressed and if we make a reasonable deduction for the white people amongst us who are foreigners and the descendants of foreigners arriving here since 1808 we shall find the increase of the black population out running that of the white to an extent unaccountable except by supposing that some of them too have been coming from africa if this be so the opening of new countries to the institution increases the demand for and augments the price of slaves and so does in fact make slaves of freemen by causing them to be brought from africa and sold into bondage but however this may be we know the opening of new countries to slavery tends to the perpetuation of the institution and so does keep men in slavery who otherwise would be free this result we do not feel like favoring and we are under no legal obligation to suppress our feelings in this respect equal justice to the south it is said requires us to consent to the extending of slavery to new countries that is to say inasmuch as you do not object to my taking my hog to nebraska therefore i must not object to you taking your slave now i admit this is perfectly logical if there is no difference between hogs and negroes but while you thus require me to deny the humanity of the negro i wish to ask whether you of the south yourselves have ever been willing to do as much it is kindly provided that of all those who come into the world only a small percentage are natural tyrants that percentage is no larger in the slave states than in the free the great majority south as well as north have human sympathies of which they can no more divest themselves than they can of their sensibility to physical pain these sympathies in the bosoms of the southern people manifest in many ways their sense of the wrong of slavery and their consciousness that after all there is humanity in the negro if they deny this let me address them a few plain questions in 1820 you joined the north almost unanimously in declaring the african slave trade piracy and in annexing to it the punishment of death why did you do this if you did not feel that it was wrong why did you join in providing that men should be hung for it the practice was no more than bringing wild negroes from africa to sell to such as would buy them but you never thought of hanging men for catching and selling wild horses wild buffaloes or wild bears again you have amongst you a sneaking individual of the class of native tyrants known as the slave dealer he watches your necessities and crawls up to buy your slave at a speculating price if you cannot help it you sell to him but if you can help it you drive him from your door you despise him utterly you do not recognize him as a friend or even as an honest man your children must not play with his they may rollick freely with the little negroes but not with the slave dealers children if you are obliged to deal with him you try to get through the job without so much as touching him it is common with you to join hands with the men you meet but with the slave dealer you avoid the ceremony instinctively shrinking from the snaky contact if he grows rich and retires from business you still remember him and still keep up the ban of non intercourse upon him and his family now why is this you do not so treat the man who deals in corn cattle or tobacco and yet again there are in the united states and territories including the district of columbia 433 643 free blacks at 500 per head they are worth over two hundred millions of dollars how comes this vast amount of property to be running about without owners we do not see free horses or free cattle running at large how is this all these free blacks are the descendants of slaves or have been slaves themselves and they would be slaves now but for something which has operated on their white owners inducing them at vast pecuniary sacrifices to liberate them what is that something is there any mistaking it in all these cases it is your sense of justice and human sympathy continually telling you that the poor negro has some natural right to himself that those who deny it and make mere merchandise of him deserve kickings contempt and death and now why will you ask us to deny the humanity of the slave and estimate him only as the equal of the hog why ask us to do what you will not do yourselves why ask us to do for nothing what two hundred million of dollars could not induce you to do but one great argument in the support of the repeal of the missouri compromise is still to come that argument is the sacred right of self government it seems our distinguished senator has found great difficulty in getting his antagonists even in the senate to meet him fairly on this argument some poet has said fools rush in where angels fear to tread at the hazzard of being thought one of the fools of this quotation i meet that argument i rush in i take that bull by the horns i trust i understand and truly estimate the right of self government my faith in the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own lies at the foundation of the sense of justice there is in me i extend the principles to communities of men as well as to individuals i so extend it because it is politically wise as well as naturally just politically wise in saving us from broils about matters which do not concern us here or at washington i would not trouble myself with the oyster laws of virginia or the cranberry laws of indiana the doctrine of self government is right absolutely and eternally right but it has no just application as here attempted or perhaps i should rather say that whether it has such just application depends upon whether a negro is not or is a man if he is not a man why in that case he who is a man may as a matter of self government do just as he pleases with him but if the negro is a man is it not to that extent a total destruction of self government to say that he too shall not govern himself when the white man governs himself that is self government but when he governs himself and also governs another man that is more than self government that is despotism if the negro is a man why then my ancient faith teaches me that all men are created equal and that there can be no moral right in connection with one man s making a slave of another judge douglas frequently with bitter irony and sarcasm paraphrases our argument by saying the white people of nebraska are good enough to govern themselves but they are not good enough to govern a few miserable negroes well i doubt not that the people of nebraska are and will continue to be as good as the average of people elsewhere i do not say the contrary what i do say is that no man is good enough to govern another man without that other s consent i say this is the leading principle the sheet anchor of american republicanism our declaration of independence says we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed i have quoted so much at this time merely to show that according to our ancient faith the just powers of governments are derived from the consent of the governed now the relation of masters and slaves is pro tanto a total violation of this principle the master not only governs the slave without his consent but he governs him by a set of rules altogether different from those which he prescribes for himself allow all the governed an equal voice in the government and that and that only is self government let it not be said i am contending for the establishment of political and social equality between the whites and blacks i have already said the contrary i am not now combating the argument of necessity arising from the fact that the blacks are already amongst us but i am combating what is set up as moral argument for allowing them to be taken where they have never yet been arguing against the extension of a bad thing which where it already exists we must of necessity manage as we best can in support of his application of the doctrine of self government senator douglas has sought to bring to his aid the opinions and examples of our revolutionary fathers i am glad he has done this i love the sentiments of those old time men and shall be most happy to abide by their opinions he shows us that when it was in contemplation for the colonies to break off from great britain and set up a new government for themselves several of the states instructed their delegates to go for the measure provided each state should be allowed to regulate its domestic concerns in its own way i do not quote but this in substance this was right i see nothing objectionable in it i also think it probable that it had some reference to the existence of slavery amongst them i will not deny that it had but had it in any reference to the carrying of slavery into new countries that is the question and we will let the fathers themselves answer it this same generation of men and mostly the same individuals of the generation who declared this principle who declared independence who fought the war of the revolution through who afterwards made the constitution under which we still live these same men passed the ordinance of 87 declaring that slavery should never go to the north west territory i have no doubt judge douglas thinks they were very inconsistent in this it is a question of discrimination between them and him but there is not an inch of ground left for his claiming that their opinions their example their authority are on his side in this controversy again is not nebraska while a territory a part of us do we not own the country and if we surrender the control of it do we not surrender the right of self government it is part of ourselves if you say we shall not control it because it is only part the same is true of every other part and when all the parts are gone what has become of the whole what is then left of us what use for the general government when there is nothing left for it govern but you say this question should be left to the people of nebraska because they are more particularly interested if this be the rule you must leave it to each individual to say for himself whether he will have slaves what better moral right have thirty one citizens of nebraska to say that the thirty second shall not hold slaves than the people of the thirty one states have to say that slavery shall not go into the thirty second state at all but if it is a sacred right for the people of nebraska to take and hold slaves there it is equally their sacred right to buy them where they can buy them cheapest and that undoubtedly will be on the coast of africa provided you will consent to not hang them for going there to buy them you must remove this restriction too from the sacred right of self government i am aware you say that taking slaves from the states of nebraska does not make slaves of freemen but the african slave trader can say just as much he does not catch free negroes and bring them here he finds them already slaves in the hands of their black captors and he honestly buys them at the rate of about a red cotton handkerchief a head this is very cheap and it is a great abridgement of the sacred right of self government to hang men for engaging in this profitable trade another important objection to this application of the right of self government is that it enables the first few to deprive the succeeding many of a free exercise of the right of self government the first few may get slavery in and the subsequent many cannot easily get it out how common is the remark now in the slave states if we were only clear of our slaves how much better it would be for us they are actually deprived of the privilege of governing themselves as they would by the action of a very few in the beginning the same thing was true of the whole nation at the time our constitution was formed whether slavery shall go into nebraska or other new territories is not a matter of exclusive concern to the people who may go there the whole nation is interested that the best use shall be made of these territories we want them for the homes of free white people this they cannot be to any considerable extent if slavery shall be planted within them slave states are places for poor white people to remove from not to remove to new free states are the places for poor people to go to and better their condition for this use the nation needs these territories still further there are constitutional relations between the slave and free states which are degrading to the latter we are under legal obligations to catch and return their runaway slaves to them a sort of dirty disagreeable job which i believe as a general rule the slave holders will not perform for one another then again in the control of the government the management of the partnership affairs they have greatly the advantage of us by the constitution each state has two senators each has a number of representatives in proportion to the number of its people and each has a number of presidential electors equal to the whole number of its senators and representatives together but in ascertaining the number of the people for this purpose five slaves are counted as being equal to three whites the slaves do not vote they are only counted and so used as to swell the influence of the white people s votes the practical effect of this is more aptly shown by a comparison of the states of south carolina and maine south carolina has six representatives and so has maine south carolina has eight presidential electors and so has maine this is precise equality so far and of course they are equal in senators each having two thus in the control of the government the two states are equals precisely but how are they in the number of their white people maine has 581 813 while south carolina has 274 567 maine has twice as many as south carolina and 32 679 over thus each white man in south carolina is more than the double of any man in maine this is all because south carolina besides her free people has 384 984 slaves the south carolinian has precisely the same advantage over the white man in every other free state as well as in maine he is more than the double of any one of us in this crowd the same advantage but not to the same extent is held by all the citizens of the slave states over those of the free and it is an absolute truth without an exception that there is no voter in any slave state but who has more legal power in the government than any voter in any free state there is no instance of exact equality and the disadvantage is against us the whole chapter through this principle in the aggregate gives the slave states in the present congress twenty additional representatives being seven more than the whole majority by which they passed the nebraska bill now all this is manifestly unfair yet i do not mention it to complain of it in so far as it is already settled it is in the constitution and i do not for that cause or any other cause propose to destroy or alter or disregard the constitution i stand to it fairly fully and firmly but when i am told i must leave it altogether to other people to say whether new partners are to be bred up and brought into the firm on the same degrading terms against me i respectfully demur i insist that whether i shall be a whole man or only the half of one in comparison with others is a question in which i am somewhat concerned and one which no other man can have a sacred right of deciding for me if i am wrong in this if it really be a sacred right of self government in the man who shall go to nebraska to decide whether he will be the equal of me or the double of me then after he shall have exercised that right and thereby shall have reduced me to a still smaller fraction of a man than i already am i should like for some gentleman deeply skilled in the mysteries of sacred rights to provide himself with a microscope and peep about and find out if he can what has become of my sacred rights they will surely be too small for detection with the naked eye finally i insist that if there is any thing which it is the duty of the whole people to never entrust to any hands but their own that thing is the preservation and perpetuity of their own liberties and institutions and if they shall think as i do that the extension of slavery endangers them more than any or all other causes how recreant to themselves if they submit the question and with it the fate of their country to a mere hand full of men bent only on temporary self interest if this question of slavery extension were an insignificant one one having no power to do harm it might be shuffled aside in this way but being as it is the great behemoth of danger shall the strong gripe of the nation be loosened upon him to entrust him to the hands of such feeble keepers i have done with this mighty argument of self government go sacred thing go in peace but nebraska is urged as a great union saving measure well i too go for saving the union much as i hate slavery i would consent to the extension of it rather than see the union dissolved just as i would consent to any great evil to avoid a greater one but when i go to union saving i must believe at least that the means i employ has some adaptation to the end to my mind nebraska has no such adaptation it hath no relish of salvation in it it is an aggravation rather of the only one thing which ever endangers the union when it came upon us all was peace and quiet the nation was looking to the forming of new bonds of union and a long course of peace and prosperity seemed to lie before us in the whole range of possibility there scarcely appears to me to have been any thing out of which the slavery agitation could have been revived except the very project of repealing the missouri compromise every inch of territory we owned already had a definite settlement of the slavery question and by which all parties were pledged to abide indeed there was no uninhabited country on the continent which we could acquire if we except some extreme northern regions which are wholly out of the question in this state of case the genius of discord himself could scarcely have invented a way of again getting us by the ears but by turning back and destroying the peace measures of the past the councils of that genius seem to have prevailed the missouri compromise was repealed and here we are in the midst of a new slavery agitation such i think as we have never seen before who is responsible for this is it those who resist the measure or those who causelessly brought it forward and pressed it through having reason to know and in fact knowing it must and would be so resisted it could not but be expected by its author that it would be looked upon as a measure for the extension of slavery aggravated by a gross breach of faith argue as you will and long as you will this is the naked front and aspect of the measure and in this aspect it could not but produce agitation slavery is founded in the selfishness of man s nature opposition to it is his love of justice these principles are an eternal antagonism and when brought into collision so fiercely as slavery extension brings them shocks and throes and convulsions must ceaselessly follow repeal the missouri compromise repeal all compromises repeal the declaration of independence repeal all past history you still can not repeal human nature it still will be the abundance of man s heart that slavery extension is wrong and out of the abundance of his heart his mouth will continue to speak the structure too of the nebraska bill is very peculiar the people are to decide the question of slavery for themselves but when they are to decide or how they are to decide or whether when the question is once decided it is to remain so or is it to be subject to an indefinite succession of new trials the law does not say is it to be decided by the first dozen settlers who arrive there or is it to await the arrival of a hundred is it to be decided by a vote of the people or a vote of the legislature or indeed by a vote of any sort to these questions the law gives no answer there is a mystery about this for when a member proposed to give the legislature express authority to exclude slavery it was hooted down by the friends of the bill this fact is worth remembering some yankees in the east are sending emigrants to nebraska to exclude slavery from it and so far as i can judge they expect the question to be decided by voting in some way or other but the missourians are awake too they are within a stone s throw of the contested ground they hold meetings and pass resolutions in which not the slightest allusion to voting is made they resolve that slavery already exists in the territory that more shall go there that they remaining in missouri will protect it and that abolitionists shall be hung or driven away through all this bowie knives and six shooters are seen plainly enough but never a glimpse of the ballot box and really what is to be the result of this each party within having numerous and determined backers without is it not probable that the contest will come to blows and bloodshed could there be a more apt invention to bring about collision and violence on the slavery question than this nebraska project is i do not charge or believe that such was intended by congress but if they had literally formed a ring and placed champions within it to fight out the controversy the fight could be no more likely to come off than it is and if this fight should begin is it likely to take a very peaceful union saving turn will not the first drop of blood so shed be the real knell of the union the missouri compromise ought to be restored for the sake of the union it ought to be restored we ought to elect a house of representatives which will vote its restoration if by any means we omit to do this what follows slavery may or may not be established in nebraska but whether it be or not we shall have repudiated discarded from the councils of the nation the spirit of compromise for who after this will ever trust in a national compromise the spirit of mutual concession that spirit which first gave us the constitution and which has thrice saved the union we shall have strangled and cast from us forever and what shall we have in lieu of it the south flushed with triumph and tempted to excesses the north betrayed as they believe brooding on wrong and burning for revenge one side will provoke the other resent the one will taunt the other defy one agrees the other retaliates already a few in the north defy all constitutional restraints resist the execution of the fugitive slave law and even menace the institution of slavery in the states where it exists already a few in the south claim the constitutional right to take to and hold slaves in the free states demand the revival of the slave trade and demand a treaty with great britain by which fugitive slaves may be reclaimed from canada as yet they are but few on either side it is a grave question for the lovers of the union whether the final destruction of the missouri compromise and with it the spirit of all compromise will or will not embolden and embitter each of these and fatally increase the numbers of both but restore the compromise and what then we thereby restore the national faith the national confidence the national feeling of brotherhood we thereby reinstate the spirit of concession and compromise that spirit which has never failed us in past perils and which may be safely trusted for all the future the south ought to join in doing this the peace of the nation is as dear to them as to us in memories of the past and hopes of the future they share as largely as we it would be on their part a great act great in its spirit and great in its effect it would be worth to the nation a hundred years purchase of peace and prosperity and what of sacrifice would they make they only surrender to us what they gave us for a consideration long long ago what they have not now asked for struggled or cared for what has been thrust upon them not less to their own astonishment than to ours but it is said we cannot restore it that though we elect every member of the lower house the senate is still against us it is quite true that of the senators who passed the nebraska bill a majority of the whole senate will retain their seats in spite of the elections of this and the next year but if at these elections their several constituencies shall clearly express their will against nebraska will these senators disregard their will will they neither obey nor make room for those who will but even if we fail to technically restore the compromise it is still a great point to carry a popular vote in favor of the restoration the moral weight of such a vote can not be estimated too highly the authors of nebraska are not at all satisfied with the destruction of the compromise an endorsement of this principle they proclaim to be the great object with them nebraska alone is a small matter to establish a principle for future use is what they particularly desire that future use is to be the planting of slavery wherever in the wide world local and unorganized opposition can not prevent it now if you wish to give them this endorsement if you wish to establish this principle do so i shall regret it but it is your right on the contrary if you are opposed to the principle intend to give it no such endorsement let no wheedling no sophistry divert you from throwing a direct vote against it some men mostly whigs who condemn the repeal of the missouri compromise nevertheless hesitate to go for its restoration lest they be thrown in company with the abolitionist will they allow me as an old whig to tell them good humoredly that i think this is very silly stand with anybody that stands right stand with him while he is right and part with him when he goes wrong stand with the abolitionist in restoring the missouri compromise and stand against him when he attempts to repeal the fugitive slave law in the latter case you stand with the southern disunionist what of that you are still right in both cases you are right in both cases you oppose the dangerous extremes in both you stand on middle ground and hold the ship level and steady in both you are national and nothing less than national this is good old whig ground to desert such ground because of any company is to be less than a whig less than a man less than an american i particularly object to the new position which the avowed principle of this nebraska law gives to slavery in the body politic i object to it because it assumes that there can be moral right in the enslaving of one man by another i object to it as a dangerous dalliance for a few people a sad evidence that feeling prosperity we forget right that liberty as a principle we have ceased to revere i object to it because the fathers of the republic eschewed and rejected it the argument of necessity was the only argument they ever admitted in favor of slavery and so far and so far only as it carried them did they ever go they found the institution existing among us which they could not help and they cast blame upon the british king for having permitted its introduction before the constitution they prohibited its introduction into the north western territory the only country we owned then free from it at the framing and adoption of the constitution they forbore to so much as mention the word slave or slavery in the whole instrument in the provision for the recovery of fugitives the slave is spoken of as a person held to service or labor in that prohibiting the abolition of the african slave trade for twenty years that trade is spoken of as the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit c these are the only provisions alluding to slavery thus the thing is hid away in the constitution just as an afflicted man hides away a wen or a cancer which he dares not cut out at once lest he bleed to death with the promise nevertheless that the cutting may begin at the end of a given time less than this our fathers could not do and now they would not do necessity drove them so far and farther they would not go but this is not all the earliest congress under the constitution took the same view of slavery they hedged and hemmed it in to the narrowest limits of necessity in 1794 they prohibited an out going slave trade that is the taking of slaves from the united states to sell in 1798 they prohibited the bringing of slaves from africa into the mississippi territory this territory then comprising what are now the states of mississippi and alabama this was ten years before they had the authority to do the same thing as to the states existing at the adoption of the constitution in 1800 they prohibited american citizens from trading in slaves between foreign countries as for instance from africa to brazil in 1803 they passed a law in aid of one or two state laws in restraint of the internal slave trade in 1807 in apparent hot haste they passed the law nearly a year in advance to take effect the first day of 1808 the very first day the constitution would permit prohibiting the african slave trade by heavy pecuniary and corporal penalties in 1820 finding these provisions ineffectual they declared the trade piracy and annexed to it the extreme penalty of death while all this was passing in the general government five or six of the original slave states had adopted systems of gradual emancipation and by which the institution was rapidly becoming extinct within these limits thus we see the plain unmistakable spirit of that age towards slavery was hostility to the principle and toleration only by necessity but now it is to be transformed into a sacred right nebraska brings it forth places it on the high road to extension and perpetuity and with a pat on its back says to it go and god speed you henceforth it is to be the chief jewel of the nation the very figure head of the ship of state little by little but steadily as man s march to the grave we have been giving up the old for the new faith near eighty years ago we began by declaring that all men are created equal but now from that beginning we have run down to the other declaration that for some men to enslave others is a sacred right of self government these principles can not stand together they are as opposite as god and mammon and whoever holds to the one must despise the other when pettit in connection with his support of the nebraska bill called the declaration of independence a self evident lie he only did what consistency and candor require all other nebraska men to do of the forty odd nebraska senators who sat present and heard him no one rebuked him nor am i apprized that any nebraska newspaper or any nebraska orator in the whole nation has ever yet rebuked him if this had been said among marion s men southerners though they were what would have become of the man who said it if this had been said to the men who captured andre the man who said it would probably have been hung sooner than andre was if it had been said in old independence hall seventy eight years ago the very door keeper would have throttled the man and thrust him into the street let no one be deceived the spirit of seventy six and the spirit of nebraska are utter antagonisms and the former is being rapidly displaced by the latter fellow countrymen americans south as well as north shall we make no effort to arrest this already the liberal party throughout the world express the apprehension that the one retrograde institution in america is undermining the principles of progress and fatally violating the noblest political system the world ever saw this is not the taunt of enemies but the warning of friends is it quite safe to disregard it to despise it is there no danger to liberty itself in discarding the earliest practice and first precept of our ancient faith in our greedy chase to make profit of the negro let us beware lest we cancel and tear to pieces even the white man s charter of freedom our republican robe is soiled and trailed in the dust let us repurify it let us turn and wash it white in the spirit if not the blood of the revolution let us turn slavery from its claims of moral right back upon its existing legal rights and its arguments of necessity let us return it to the position our fathers gave it and there let it rest in peace let us re adopt the declaration of independence and with it the practices and policy which harmonize with it let north and south let all americans let all lovers of liberty everywhere join in the great and good work if we do this we shall not only have saved the union but we shall have so saved it as to make and to keep it forever worthy of the saving we shall have so saved it that the succeeding millions of free happy people the world over shall rise up and call us blessed to the latest generations at springfield twelve days ago where i had spoken substantially as i have here judge douglas replied to me and as he is to reply to me here i shall attempt to anticipate him by noticing some of the points he made there he commenced by stating i had assumed all the way through that the principle of the nebraska bill would have the effect of extending slavery he denied that this was intended or that this effect would follow i will not re open the argument upon this point that such was the intention the world believed at the start and will continue to believe this was the countenance of the thing and both friends and enemies instantly recognized it as such that countenance can not now be changed by argument you can as easily argue the color out of the negroes skin like the bloody hand you may wash it and wash it the red witness of guilt still sticks and stares horribly at you next he says congressional intervention never prevented slavery any where that it did not prevent it in the north west territory now in illinois that in fact illinois came into the union as a slave state that the principle of the nebraska bill expelled it from illinois from several old states from every where now this is mere quibbling all the way through if the ordinance of 87 did not keep slavery out of the north west territory how happens it that the north west shore of the ohio river is entirely free from it while the south east shore less than a mile distant along nearly the whole length of the river is entirely covered with it if that ordinance did not keep it out of illinois what was it that made the difference between illinois and missouri they lie side by side the mississippi river only dividing them while their early settlements were within the same latitude between 1810 and 1820 the number of slaves in missouri increased 7 211 while in illinois in the same ten years they decreased 51 this appears by the census returns during nearly all of that ten years both were territories not states during this time the ordinance forbid slavery to go into illinois and nothing forbid it to go into missouri it did go into missouri and did not go into illinois that is the fact can any one doubt as to the reason of it but he says illinois came into the union as a slave state silence perhaps would be the best answer to this flat contradiction of the known history of the country what are the facts upon which this bold assertion is based when we first acquired the country as far back as 1787 there were some slaves within it held by the french inhabitants at kaskaskia the territorial legislation admitted a few negroes from the slave states as indentured servants one year after the adoption of the first state constitution the whole number of them was what do you think just 117 while the aggregate free population was 55 094 about 470 to one upon this state of facts the people framed their constitution prohibiting the further introduction of slavery with a sort of guaranty to the owners of the few indentured servants giving freedom to their children to be born thereafter and making no mention whatever of any supposed slave for life out of this small matter the judge manufactures his argument that illinois came into the union as a slave state let the facts be the answer to the argument the principles of the nebraska bill he says expelled slavery from illinois the principle of that bill first planted it here that is it first came because there was no law to prevent it first came before we owned the country and finding it here and having the ordinance of 87 to prevent its increasing our people struggled along and finally got rid of it as best they could but the principle of the nebraska bill abolished slavery in several of the old states well it is true that several of the old states in the last quarter of the last century did adopt systems of gradual emancipation by which the institution has finally become extinct within their limits but it may or may not be true that the principle of the nebraska bill was the cause that led to the adoption of these measures it is now more than fifty years since the last of these states adopted its system of emancipation if nebraska bill is the real author of these benevolent works it is rather deplorable that he has for so long a time ceased working all together is there not some reason to suspect that it was the principle of the revolution and not the principle of nebraska bill that led to emancipation in these old states leave it to the people of those old emancipating states and i am quite sure they will decide that neither that nor any other good thing ever did or ever will come of nebraska bill in the course of my main argument judge douglas interrupted me to say that the principle the nebraska bill was very old that it originated when god made man and placed good and evil before him allowing him to choose for himself being responsible for the choice he should make at the time i thought this was merely playful and i answered it accordingly but in his reply to me he renewed it as a serious argument in seriousness then the facts of this proposition are not true as stated god did not place good and evil before man telling him to make his choice on the contrary he did tell him there was one tree of the fruit of which he should not eat upon pain of certain death i should scarcely wish so strong a prohibition against slavery in nebraska but this argument strikes me as not a little remarkable in another particular in its strong resemblance to the old argument for the divine right of kings by the latter the king is to do just as he pleases with his white subjects being responsible to god alone by the former the white man is to do just as he pleases with his black slaves being responsible to god alone the two things are precisely alike and it is but natural that they should find similar arguments to sustain them i had argued that the application of the principle of self government as contended for would require the revival of the african slave trade that no argument could be made in favor of a man s right to take slaves to nebraska which could not be equally well made in favor of his right to bring them from the coast of africa the judge replied that the constitution requires the suppression of the foreign slave trade but does not require the prohibition of slavery in the territories that is a mistake in point of fact the constitution does not require the action of congress in either case and it does authorize it in both and so there is still no difference between the cases in regard to what i had said the advantage the slave states have over the free in the matter of representation the judge replied that we in the free states count five free negroes as five white people while in the slave states they count five slaves as three whites only and that the advantage at last was on the side of the free states now in the slave states they count free negroes just as we do and it so happens that besides their slaves they have as many free negroes as we have and thirty three thousand over thus their free negroes more than balance ours and their advantage over us in consequence of their slaves still remains as i stated it in reply to my argument that the compromise measures of 1850 were a system of equivalents and that the provisions of no one of them could fairly be carried to other subjects without its corresponding equivalent being carried with it the judge denied out right that these measures had any connection with or dependence upon each other this is mere desperation if they have no connection why are they always spoken of in connection why has he so spoken of them a thousand times why has he constantly called them a series of measures why does everybody call them a compromise why was california kept out of the union six or seven months if it was not because of its connection with the other measures webster s leading definition of the verb to compromise is to adjust and settle a difference by mutual agreement with concessions of claims by the parties this conveys precisely the popular understanding of the word compromise we knew before the judge told us that these measures passed separately and in distinct bills and that no two of them were passed by the votes of precisely the same members but we also know and so does he know that no one of them could have passed both branches of congress but for the understanding that the others were to pass also upon this understanding each got votes which it could have got in no other way it is this fact that gives to the measures their true character and it is the universal knowledge of this fact that has given them the name of compromise so expressive of that true character i had asked if in carrying the provisions of the utah and new mexico laws to nebraska you could clear away other objection how can you leave nebraska perfectly free to introduce slavery before she forms a constitution during her territorial government while the utah and new mexico laws only authorize it when they form constitutions and are admitted into the union to this judge douglas answered that the utah and new mexico laws also authorized it before and to prove this he read from one of their laws as follows that the legislative power of said territory shall extend to all rightful subjects of legislation consistent with the constitution of the united states and the provisions of this act now it is perceived from the reading of this that there is nothing express upon the subject but that the authority is sought to be implied merely for the general provision of all rightful subjects of legislation in reply to this i insist as a legal rule of construction as well as the plain popular view of the matter that the express provision for utah and new mexico coming in with slavery if they choose when they shall form constitutions is an exclusion of all implied authority on the same subject that congress having the subject distinctly in their minds when they made the express provision they therein expressed their whole meaning on that subject the judge rather insinuated that i had found it convenient to forget the washington territorial law passed in 1853 this was a division of oregon organizing the northern part as the territory of washington he asserted that by this act the ordinance of 87 theretofore existing in oregon was repealed that nearly all the members of congress voted for it beginning in the h r with charles allen of massachusetts and ending with richard yates of illinois and that he could not understand how those who now oppose the nebraska bill so voted then unless it was because it was then too soon after both the great political parties had ratified the compromises of 1850 and the ratification therefore too fresh to be then repudiated now i had seen the washington act before and i have carefully examined it since and i aver that there is no repeal of the ordinance of 87 or of any prohibition of slavery in it in express terms there is absolutely nothing in the whole law upon the subject in fact nothing to lead a reader to think of the subject to my judgment it is equally free from every thing from which such repeal can be legally implied but however this may be are men now to be entrapped by a legal implication extracted from covert language introduced perhaps for the very purpose of entrapping them i sincerely wish every man could read this law quite through carefully watching every sentence and every line for a repeal of the ordinance of 87 or any thing equivalent to it another point on the washington act if it was intended to be modelled after the utah and new mexico acts as judge douglas insists why was it not inserted in it as in them that washington was to come in with or without slavery as she may choose at the adoption of her constitution it has no such provision in it and i defy the ingenuity of man to give a reason for the omission other than that it was not intended to follow the utah and new mexico laws in regard to the question of slavery the washington act not only differs vitally from the utah and new mexico acts but the nebraska act differs vitally from both by the latter act the people are left perfectly free to regulate their own domestic concerns c but in all the former all their laws are to be submitted to congress and if disapproved are to be null the washington act goes even further it absolutely prohibits the territorial legislation by very strong and guarded language from establishing banks or borrowing money on the faith of the territory is this the sacred right of self government we hear vaunted so much no sir the nebraska bill finds no model in the acts of 50 or the washington act it finds no model in any law from adam till today as phillips says of napoleon the nebraska act is grand gloomy and peculiar wrapped in the solitude of its own originality without a model and without a shadow upon the earth in the course of his reply senator douglas remarked in substance that he had always considered this government was made for the white people and not for the negroes why in point of mere fact i think so too but in this remark of the judge there is a significance which i think is the key to the great mistake if there is any such mistake which he has made in this nebraska measure it shows that the judge has no very vivid impression that the negro is a human and consequently has no idea that there can be any moral question in legislating about him in his view the question of whether a new country shall be slave or free is a matter of as utter indifference as it is whether his neighbor shall plant his farm with tobacco or stock it with horned cattle now whether this view is right or wrong it is very certain that the great mass of mankind take a totally different view they consider slavery a great moral wrong and their feelings against it is not evanescent but eternal it lies at the very foundation of their sense of justice and it cannot be trifled with it is a great and durable element of popular action and i think no statesman can safely disregard it our senator also objects that those who oppose him in this measure do not entirely agree with one another he reminds me that in my firm adherence to the constitutional rights of the slave states i differ widely from others who are co operating with me in opposing the nebraska bill and he says it is not quite fair to oppose him in this variety of ways he should remember that he took us by surprise astounded us by this measure we were thunderstruck and stunned and we reeled and fell in utter confusion but we rose each fighting grasping whatever he could first reach a scythe a pitchfork a chopping axe or a butcher s cleaver we struck in the direction of the sound and we are rapidly closing in upon him he must not think to divert us from our purpose by showing us that our drill our dress and our weapons are not entirely perfect and uniform when the storm shall be past he shall find us still americans no less devoted to the continued union and prosperity of the country than heretofore finally the judge invokes against me the memory of clay and of webster they were great men and men of great deeds but where have i assailed them for what is it that their life long enemy shall now make profit by assuming to defend them against me their life long friend i go against the repeal of the missouri compromise did they ever go for it they went for the compromise of 1850 did i ever go against them they were greatly devoted to the union to the small measure of my ability was i ever less so clay and webster were dead before this question arose by what authority shall our senator say they would espouse his side of it if alive mr clay was the leading spirit in making the missouri compromise is it very credible that if now alive he would take the lead in the breaking of it the truth is that some support from whigs is now a necessity with the judge and for thus it is that the names of clay and webster are now invoked his old friends have deserted him in such numbers as to leave too few to live by he came to his own and his own received him not and lo he turns unto the gentiles a word now as to the judge s desperate assumption that the compromises of 50 had no connection with one another that illinois came into the union as a slave state and some other similar ones this is no other than a bold denial of the history of the country if we do not know that the compromises of 50 were dependent on each other if we do not know that illinois came into the union as a free state we do not know any thing if we do not know these things we do not know that we ever had a revolutionary war or such a chief as washington to deny these things is to deny our national axioms or dogmas at least and it puts an end to all argument if a man will stand up and assert and repeat and re assert that two and two do not make four i know nothing in the power of argument that can stop him i think i can answer the judge so long as he sticks to the premises but when he flies from them i can not work an argument into the consistency of a maternal gag and actually close his mouth with it in such a case i can only commend him to the seventy thousand answers just in from pennsylvania ohio and indiana

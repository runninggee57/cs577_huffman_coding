president newcomb my friends of the university of virginia i notice by the program that i am asked to address the class of 1940 i avail myself of that privilege but i also take this very apt occasion to speak to many other classes that have graduated through all the years classes that are still in the period of study not alone in the schools of learning of the nation but classes that have come up through the great schools of experience in other words a cross section of the country just as you who graduate today are a cross section of the nation as a whole every generation of young men and women in america has questions to ask the world most of the time they are the simple but nevertheless difficult questions questions of work to do opportunities to find ambitions to satisfy but every now and again in the history of the republic a different kind of question presents itself a question that asks not about the future of an individual or even of a generation but about the future of the country the future of the american people there was such a time at the beginning of our history as a nation young people asked themselves in those days what lay ahead not for themselves but for the new united states there was such a time again in the seemingly endless years of the war between the states young men and young women on both sides of the line asked themselves not what trades or professions they would enter what lives they would make but what was to become of the country they had known there is such a time again today again today the young men and the young women of america ask themselves with earnestness and with deep concern this same question what is to become of the country we know now they ask it with even greater anxiety than before they ask not only what the future holds for this republic but what the future holds for all peoples and all nations that have been living under democratic forms of government under the free institutions of a free people it is understandable to all of us that they should ask this question they read the words of those who are telling them that the ideal of individual liberty the ideal of free franchise the ideal of peace through justice are decadent ideals they read the word and hear the boast of those who say that a belief in force force directed by self chosen leaders is the new and vigorous system which will overrun the earth they have seen the ascendancy of this philosophy of force in nation after nation where free institutions and individual liberties were once maintained it is natural and understandable that the younger generation should first ask itself what the extension of the philosophy of force to all the world would lead to ultimately we see today in stark reality some of the consequences of what we call the machine age where control of machines has been retained in the hands of mankind as a whole untold benefits have accrued to mankind for mankind was then the master and the machine was the servant but in this new system of force the mastery of the machine is not in the hands of mankind it is in the control of infinitely small groups of individuals who rule without a single one of the democratic sanctions that we have known the machine in hands of irresponsible conquerors becomes the master mankind is not only the servant it is the victim too such mastery abandons with deliberate contempt all the moral values to which even this young country for more than three hundred years has been accustomed and dedicated surely the new philosophy proves from month to month that it could have no possible conception of the way of life or the way of thought of a nation whose origins go back to jamestown and plymouth rock conversely neither those who spring from that ancient stock nor those who have come hither in later years can be indifferent to the destruction of freedom in their ancestral lands across the sea perception of danger to our institutions may come slowly or it may come with a rush and a shock as it has to the people of the united states in the past few months this perception of danger has come to us clearly and overwhelmingly and we perceive the peril in a world wide arena an arena that may become so narrowed that only the americas will retain the ancient faiths some indeed still hold to the now somewhat obvious delusion that we of the united states can safely permit the united states to become a lone island a lone island in a world dominated by the philosophy of force such an island may be the dream of those who still talk and vote as isolationists such an island represents to me and to the overwhelming majority of americans today a helpless nightmare of a people without freedom the nightmare of a people lodged in prison handcuffed hungry and fed through the bars from day to day by the contemptuous unpitying masters of other continents it is natural also that we should ask ourselves how now we can prevent the building of that prison and the placing of ourselves in the midst of it let us not hesitate all of us to proclaim certain truths overwhelmingly we as a nation and this applies to all the other american nations are convinced that military and naval victory for the gods of force and hate would endanger the institutions of democracy in the western world and that equally therefore the whole of our sympathies lies with those nations that are giving their life blood in combat against these forces the people and the government of the united states have seen with the utmost regret and with grave disquiet the decision of the italian government to engage in the hostilities now raging in europe more than three months ago the chief of the italian government sent me word that because of the determination of italy to limit so far as might be possible the spread of the european conflict more than two hundred millions of people in the region of the mediterranean had been enabled to escape the suffering and the devastation of war i informed the chief of the italian government that this desire on the part of italy to prevent the war from spreading met with full sympathy and response on the part of the government and the people of the united states and i expressed the earnest hope of this government and of this people that this policy on the part of italy might be continued i made it clear that in the opinion of the government of the united states any extension of hostilities in the region of the mediterranean might result in a still greater enlargement of the scene of the conflict the conflict in the near east and in africa and that if this came to pass no one could foretell how much greater the theater of the war eventually might become again on a subsequent occasion not so long ago recognizing that certain aspirations of italy might form the basis of discussions among the powers most specifically concerned i offered in a message addressed to the chief of the italian government to send to the governments of france and of great britain such specific indications of the desires of italy to obtain readjustments with regard to her position as the chief of the italian government might desire to transmit through me while making it clear that the government of the united states in such an event could not and would not assume responsibility for the nature of the proposals submitted nor for agreements which might thereafter be reached i proposed that if italy would refrain from entering the war i would be willing to ask assurances from the other powers concerned that they would faithfully execute any agreement so reached and that italy s voice in any future peace conference would have the same authority as if italy had actually taken part in the war as a belligerent unfortunately to the regret of all of us and the regret of humanity the chief of the italian government was unwilling to accept the procedure suggested and he has made no counter proposal this government directed its efforts to doing what it could to work for the preservation of peace in the mediterranean area and it likewise expressed its willingness to endeavor to cooperate with the government of italy when the appropriate occasion arose for the creation of a more stable world order through the reduction of armaments and through the construction of a more liberal international economic system which would assure to all powers equality of opportunity in the world s markets and in the securing of raw materials on equal terms i have likewise of course felt it necessary in my communications to signor mussolini to express the concern of the government of the united states because of the fact that any extension of the war in the region of the mediterranean would inevitably result in great prejudice to the ways of life and government and to the trade and commerce of all the american republics the government of italy has now chosen to preserve what it terms its freedom of action and to fulfill what it states are its promises to germany in so doing it has manifested disregard for the rights and security of other nations disregard for the lives of the peoples of those nations which are directly threatened by this spread of the war and has evidenced its unwillingness to find the means through pacific negotiations for the satisfaction of what it believes are its legitimate aspirations on this tenth day of june 1940 the hand that held the dagger has struck it into the back of its neighbor on this tenth day of june 1940 in this university founded by the first great american teacher of democracy we send forth our prayers and our hopes to those beyond the seas who are maintaining with magnificent valor their battle for freedom in our american unity we will pursue two obvious and simultaneous courses we will extend to the opponents of force the material resources of this nation and at the same time we will harness and speed up the use of those resources in order that we ourselves in the americas may have equipment and training equal to the task of any emergency and every defense all roads leading to the accomplishment of these objectives must be kept clear of obstructions we will not slow down or detour signs and signals call for speed full speed ahead it is right that each new generation should ask questions but in recent months the principal question has been somewhat simplified once more the future of the nation and of the american people is at stake we need not and we will not in any way abandon our continuing effort to make democracy work within our borders we still insist on the need for vast improvements in our own social and economic life but that is a component part of national defense itself the program unfolds swiftly and into that program will fit the responsibility and the opportunity of every man and woman in the land to preserve his and her heritage in days of peril i call for effort courage sacrifice devotion granting the love of freedom all of these are possible and the love of freedom is still fierce and steady in the nation today

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states in calling you together fellow citizens at an earlier day than was contemplated by the act of the last session of congress i have not been insensible to the personal inconveniences necessarily resulting from an unexpected change in your arrangements but matters of great public concernment have rendered this call necessary and the interest you feel in these will supersede in your minds all private considerations congress witnessed at their last session the extraordinary agitation produced in the public mind by the suspension of our right of deposit at the port of new orleans no assignment of another place having been made according to treaty they were sensible that the continuance of that privation would be more injurious to our nation than any consequences which could flow from any mode of redress but reposing just confidence in the good faith of the government whose officer had committed the wrong friendly and reasonable representations were resorted to and the right of deposit was restored previous however to this period we had not been unaware of the danger to which our peace would be perpetually exposed while so important a key to the commerce of the western country remained under foreign power difficulties too were presenting themselves as to the navigation of other streams which arising within our territories pass through those adjacent propositions had therefore been authorized for obtaining on fair conditions the sovereignty of new orleans and of other possessions in that quarter interesting to our quiet to such extent as was deemed practicable and the provisional appropriation of two millions of dollars to be applied and accounted for by the president of the united states intended as part of the price was considered as conveying the sanction of congress to the acquisition proposed the enlightened government of france saw with just discernment the importance to both nations of such liberal arrangements as might best and permanently promote the peace friendship and interests of both and the property and sovereignty of all louisiana which had been restored to them have on certain conditions been transferred to the united states by instruments bearing date the 30th of april last when these shall have received the constitutional sanction of the senate they will without delay be communicated to the representatives also for the exercise of their functions as to those conditions which are within the powers vested by the constitution in congress while the property and sovereignty of the mississippi and its waters secure an independent outlet for the produce of the western states and an uncontrolled navigation through their whole course free from collision with other powers and the dangers to our peace from that source the fertility of the country its climate and extent promise in due season important aids to our treasury an ample provision for our posterity and a wide spread field for the blessings of freedom and equal laws with the wisdom of congress it will rest to take those ulterior measures which may be necessary for the immediate occupation and temporary government of the country for its incorporation into our union for rendering the change of government a blessing to our newly adopted brethren for securing to them the rights of conscience and of property for confirming to the indian inhabitants their occupancy and self government establishing friendly and commercial relations with them and for ascertaining the geography of the country acquired such materials for your information relative to its affairs in general as the short space of time has permitted me to collect will be laid before you when the subject shall be in a state for your consideration another important acquisition of territory has also been made since the last session of congress the friendly tribe of kaskaskia indians with which we have never had a difference reduced by the wars and wants of savage life to a few individuals unable to defend themselves against the neighboring tribes has transferred its country to the united states reserving only for its members what is sufficient to maintain them in an agricultural way the considerations stipulated are that we shall extend to them our patronage and protection and give them certain annual aids in money in implements of agriculture and other articles of their choice this country among the most fertile within our limits extending along the mississippi from the mouth of the illinois to and up the ohio though not so necessary as a barrier since the acquisition of the other bank may yet be well worthy of being laid open to immediate settlement as its inhabitants may descend with rapidity in support of the lower country should future circumstances expose that to foreign enterprise as the stipulations in this treaty also involve matters within the competence of both houses only it will be laid before congress as soon as the senate shall have advised its ratification with many other indian tribes improvements in agriculture and household manufacture are advancing and with all our peace and friendship are established on grounds much firmer than heretofore the measure adopted of establishing trading houses among them and of furnishing them necessaries in exchange for their commodities at such moderated prices as leave no gain but cover us from loss has the most conciliatory and useful effect upon them and is that which will best secure their peace and good will the small vessels authorized by congress with a view to the mediterranean service have been sent into that sea and will be able more effectually to confine the tripoline cruisers within their harbors and supersede the necessity of convoy to our commerce in that quarter they will sensibly lessen the expenses of that service the ensuing year a further knowledge of the ground in the north eastern and north western angles of the united states has evinced that the boundaries established by the treaty of paris between the british territories and ours in those parts were too imperfectly described to be susceptible of execution it has therefore been thought worthy of attention for preserving and cherishing the harmony and useful intercourse subsisting between the two nations to remove by timely arrangements what unfavorable incidents might otherwise render a ground of future misunderstanding a convention has therefore been entered into which provides for a practicable demarkation of those limits to the satisfaction of both parties an account of the receipts and expenditures of the year ending 30th september last with the estimates for the service of the ensuing year will be laid before you by the secretary of the treasury so soon as the receipts of the last quarter shall be returned from the more distant states it is already ascertained that the amount paid into the treasury for that year has been between eleven and twelve millions of dollars and that the revenue accrued during the same term exceeds the sum counted on as sufficient for our current expenses and to extinguish the public debt within the period heretofore proposed the amount of debt paid for the same year is about three millions one hundred thousand dollars exclusive of interest and making with the payment of the preceding year a discharge of more than eight millions and a half of dollars of the principal of that debt besides the accruing interest and there remain in the treasury nearly six millions of dollars of these eight hundred and eighty thousand have been reserved for payment of the first instalment due under the british convention of january 8th 1802 and two millions are what have been before mentioned as placed by congress under the power and accountability of the president toward the price of new orleans and other territories acquired which remaining untouched are still applicable to that object and go in diminution of the sum to be funded for it should the acquisition of louisiana be constitutionally confirmed and carried into effect a sum of nearly thirteen millions of dollars will then be added to our public debt most of which is payable after fifteen years before which term the present existing debts will all be discharged by the established operation of the sinking fund when we contemplate the ordinary annual augmentation of imposts from increasing population and wealth the augmentation of the same revenue by its extension to the new acquisition and the economies which may still be introduced into our public expenditures i cannot but hope that congress in reviewing their resources will find means to meet the intermediate interests of this additional debt without recurring to new taxes and applying to this object only the ordinary progression of our revenue its extraordinary increase in times of foreign war will be the proper and sufficient fund for any measures of safety or precaution which that state of things may render necessary in our neutral position remittances for the instalments of our foreign debt having been found impracticable without loss it has not been thought expedient to use the power given by a former act of congress of continuing them by reloans and of redeeming instead thereof equal sums of domestic debt although no difficulty was found in obtaining that accommodation the sum of fifty thousand dollars appropriated by congress for providing gun boats remains unexpended the favorable and peaceful turn of affairs on the mississippi rendered an immediate execution of that law unnecessary and time was desirable in order that the institution of that branch of our force might begin on models the most approved by experience the same issue of events dispensed with a resort to the appropriation of a million and a half of dollars contemplated for purposes which were effected by happier means we have seen with sincere concern the flames of war lighted up again in europe and nations with which we have the most friendly and useful relations engaged in mutual destruction while we regret the miseries in which we see others involved let us bow with gratitude to that kind providence which inspiring with wisdom and moderation our late legislative councils while placed under the urgency of the greatest wrongs guarded us from hastily entering into the sanguinary contest and left us only to look on and to pity its ravages these will be heaviest on those immediately engaged yet the nations pursuing peace will not be exempt from all evil in the course of this conflict let it be our endeavor as it is our interest and desire to cultivate the friendship of the belligerent nations by every act of justice and of incessant kindness to receive their armed vessels with hospitality from the distresses of the sea but to administer the means of annoyance to none to establish in our harbors such a police as may maintain law and order to restrain our citizens from embarking individually in a war in which their country takes no part to punish severely those persons citizen or alien who shall usurp the cover of our flag for vessels not entitled to it infecting thereby with suspicion those of real americans and committing us into controversies for the redress of wrongs not our own to exact from every nation the observance toward our vessels and citizens of those principles and practices which all civilized people acknowledge to merit the character of a just nation and maintain that of an independent one preferring every consequence to insult and habitual wrong congress will consider whether the existing laws enable us efficaciously to maintain this course with our citizens in all places and with others while within the limits of our jurisdiction and will give them the new modifications necessary for these objects some contraventions of right have already taken place both within our jurisdictional limits and on the high seas the friendly disposition of the governments from whose agents they have proceeded as well as their wisdom and regard for justice leave us in reasonable expectation that they will be rectified and prevented in future and that no act will be countenanced by them which threatens to disturb our friendly intercourse separated by a wide ocean from the nations of europe and from the political interests which entangle them together with productions and wants which render our commerce and friendship useful to them and theirs to us it cannot be the interest of any to assail us nor ours to disturb them we should be most unwise indeed were we to cast away the singular blessings of the position in which nature has placed us the opportunity she has endowed us with of pursuing at a distance from foreign contentions the paths of industry peace and happiness of cultivating general friendship and of bringing collisions of interest to the umpirage of reason rather than of force how desirable then must it be in a government like ours to see its citizens adopt individually the views the interests and the conduct which their country should pursue divesting themselves of those passions and partialities which tend to lessen useful friendships and to embarrass and embroil us in the calamitous scenes of europe confident fellow citizens that you will duly estimate the importance of neutral dispositions toward the observance of neutral conduct that you will be sensible how much it is our duty to look on the bloody arena spread before us with commiseration indeed but with no other wish than to see it closed i am persuaded you will cordially cherish these dispositions in all discussions among yourselves and in all communications with your constituents and i anticipate with satisfaction the measures of wisdom which the great interests now committed to _you_ will give you an opportunity of providing and _myself_ that of approving and carrying into execution with the fidelity i owe to my country

to the senate and house of representatives the congress assembles this year under the shadow of a great calamity on the sixth of september president mckinley was shot by an anarchist while attending the pan american exposition at buffalo and died in that city on the fourteenth of that month of the last seven elected presidents he is the third who has been murdered and the bare recital of this fact is sufficient to justify grave alarm among all loyal american citizens moreover the circumstances of this the third assassination of an american president have a peculiarly sinister significance both president lincoln and president garfield were killed by assassins of types unfortunately not uncommon in history president lincoln falling a victim to the terrible passions aroused by four years of civil war and president garfield to the revengeful vanity of a disappointed office seeker president mckinley was killed by an utterly depraved criminal belonging to that body of criminals who object to all governments good and bad alike who are against any form of popular liberty if it is guaranteed by even the most just and liberal laws and who are as hostile to the upright exponent of a free people s sober will as to the tyrannical and irresponsible despot it is not too much to say that at the time of president mckinley s death he was the most widely loved man in all the united states while we have never had any public man of his position who has been so wholly free from the bitter animosities incident to public life his political opponents were the first to bear the heartiest and most generous tribute to the broad kindliness of nature the sweetness and gentleness of character which so endeared him to his close associates to a standard of lofty integrity in public life he united the tender affections and home virtues which are all important in the make up of national character a gallant soldier in the great war for the union he also shone as an example to all our people because of his conduct in the most sacred and intimate of home relations there could be no personal hatred of him for he never acted with aught but consideration for the welfare of others no one could fail to respect him who knew him in public or private life the defenders of those murderous criminals who seek to excuse their criminality by asserting that it is exercised for political ends inveigh against wealth and irresponsible power but for this assassination even this base apology cannot be urged president mckinley was a man of moderate means a man whose stock sprang from the sturdy tillers of the soil who had himself belonged among the wage workers who had entered the army as a private soldier wealth was not struck at when the president was assassinated but the honest toil which is content with moderate gains after a lifetime of unremitting labor largely in the service of the public still less was power struck at in the sense that power is irresponsible or centered in the hands of any one individual the blow was not aimed at tyranny or wealth it was aimed at one of the strongest champions the wage worker has ever had at one of the most faithful representatives of the system of public rights and representative government who has ever risen to public office president mckinley filled that political office for which the entire people vote and no president not even lincoln himself was ever more earnestly anxious to represent the well thought out wishes of the people his one anxiety in every crisis was to keep in closest touch with the people to find out what they thought and to endeavor to give expression to their thought after having endeavored to guide that thought aright he had just been reelected to the presidency because the majority of our citizens the majority of our farmers and wage workers believed that he had faithfully upheld their interests for four years they felt themselves in close and intimate touch with him they felt that he represented so well and so honorably all their ideals and aspirations that they wished him to continue for another four years to represent them and this was the man at whom the assassin struck that there might be nothing lacking to complete the judas like infamy of his act he took advantage of an occasion when the president was meeting the people generally and advancing as if to take the hand out stretched to him in kindly and brotherly fellowship he turned the noble and generous confidence of the victim into an opportunity to strike the fatal blow there is no baser deed in all the annals of crime the shock the grief of the country are bitter in the minds of all who saw the dark days while the president yet hovered between life and death at last the light was stilled in the kindly eyes and the breath went from the lips that even in mortal agony uttered no words save of forgiveness to his murderer of love for his friends and of faltering trust in the will of the most high such a death crowning the glory of such a life leaves us with infinite sorrow but with such pride in what he had accomplished and in his own personal character that we feel the blow not as struck at him but as struck at the nation we mourn a good and great president who is dead but while we mourn we are lifted up by the splendid achievements of his life and the grand heroism with which he met his death when we turn from the man to the nation the harm done is so great as to excite our gravest apprehensions and to demand our wisest and most resolute action this criminal was a professed anarchist inflamed by the teachings of professed anarchists and probably also by the reckless utterances of those who on the stump and in the public press appeal to the dark and evil spirits of malice and greed envy and sullen hatred the wind is sowed by the men who preach such doctrines and they cannot escape their share of responsibility for the whirlwind that is reaped this applies alike to the deliberate demagogue to the exploiter of sensationalism and to the crude and foolish visionary who for whatever reason apologizes for crime or excites aimless discontent the blow was aimed not at this president but at all presidents at every symbol of government president mckinley was as emphatically the embodiment of the popular will of the nation expressed through the forms of law as a new england town meeting is in similar fashion the embodiment of the law abiding purpose and practice of the people of the town on no conceivable theory could the murder of the president be accepted as due to protest against inequalities in the social order save as the murder of all the freemen engaged in a town meeting could be accepted as a protest against that social inequality which puts a malefactor in jail anarchy is no more an expression of social discontent than picking pockets or wife beating the anarchist and especially the anarchist in the united states is merely one type of criminal more dangerous than any other because he represents the same depravity in a greater degree the man who advocates anarchy directly or indirectly in any shape or fashion or the man who apologizes for anarchists and their deeds makes himself morally accessory to murder before the fact the anarchist is a criminal whose perverted instincts lead him to prefer confusion and chaos to the most beneficent form of social order his protest of concern for workingmen is outrageous in its impudent falsity for if the political institutions of this country do not afford opportunity to every honest and intelligent son of toil then the door of hope is forever closed against him the anarchist is everywhere not merely the enemy of system and of progress but the deadly foe of liberty if ever anarchy is triumphant its triumph will last for but one red moment to be succeeded for ages by the gloomy night of despotism for the anarchist himself whether he preaches or practices his doctrines we need not have one particle more concern than for any ordinary murderer he is not the victim of social or political injustice there are no wrongs to remedy in his case the cause of his criminality is to be found in his own evil passions and in the evil conduct of those who urge him on not in any failure by others or by the state to do justice to him or his he is a malefactor and nothing else he is in no sense in no shape or way a product of social conditions save as a highwayman is produced by the fact than an unarmed man happens to have a purse it is a travesty upon the great and holy names of liberty and freedom to permit them to be invoked in such a cause no man or body of men preaching anarchistic doctrines should be allowed at large any more than if preaching the murder of some specified private individual anarchistic speeches writings and meetings are essentially seditious and treasonable i earnestly recommend to the congress that in the exercise of its wise discretion it should take into consideration the coming to this country of anarchists or persons professing principles hostile to all government and justifying the murder of those placed in authority such individuals as those who not long ago gathered in open meeting to glorify the murder of king humbert of italy perpetrate a crime and the law should ensure their rigorous punishment they and those like them should be kept out of this country and if found here they should be promptly deported to the country whence they came and far reaching provision should be made for the punishment of those who stay no matter calls more urgently for the wisest thought of the congress the federal courts should be given jurisdiction over any man who kills or attempts to kill the president or any man who by the constitution or by law is in line of succession for the presidency while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to the enormity of the offense against our institutions anarchy is a crime against the whole human race and all mankind should band against the anarchist his crime should be made an offense against the law of nations like piracy and that form of man stealing known as the slave trade for it is of far blacker infamy than either it should be so declared by treaties among all civilized powers such treaties would give to the federal government the power of dealing with the crime a grim commentary upon the folly of the anarchist position was afforded by the attitude of the law toward this very criminal who had just taken the life of the president the people would have torn him limb from limb if it had not been that the law he defied was at once invoked in his behalf so far from his deed being committed on behalf of the people against the government the government was obliged at once to exert its full police power to save him from instant death at the hands of the people moreover his deed worked not the slightest dislocation in our governmental system and the danger of a recurrence of such deeds no matter how great it might grow would work only in the direction of strengthening and giving harshness to the forces of order no man will ever be restrained from becoming president by any fear as to his personal safety if the risk to the president s life became great it would mean that the office would more and more come to be filled by men of a spirit which would make them resolute and merciless in dealing with every friend of disorder this great country will not fall into anarchy and if anarchists should ever become a serious menace to its institutions they would not merely be stamped out but would involve in their own ruin every active or passive sympathizer with their doctrines the american people are slow to wrath but when their wrath is once kindled it burns like a consuming flame during the last five years business confidence has been restored and the nation is to be congratulated because of its present abounding prosperity such prosperity can never be created by law alone although it is easy enough to destroy it by mischievous laws if the hand of the lord is heavy upon any country if flood or drought comes human wisdom is powerless to avert the calamity moreover no law can guard us against the consequences of our own folly the men who are idle or credulous the men who seek gains not by genuine work with head or hand but by gambling in any form are always a source of menace not only to themselves but to others if the business world loses its head it loses what legislation cannot supply fundamentally the welfare of each citizen and therefore the welfare of the aggregate of citizens which makes the nation must rest upon individual thrift and energy resolution and intelligence nothing can take the place of this individual capacity but wise legislation and honest and intelligent administration can give it the fullest scope the largest opportunity to work to good effect the tremendous and highly complex industrial development which went on with ever accelerated rapidity during the latter half of the nineteenth century brings us face to face at the beginning of the twentieth with very serious social problems the old laws and the old customs which had almost the binding force of law were once quite sufficient to regulate the accumulation and distribution of wealth since the industrial changes which have so enormously increased the productive power of mankind they are no longer sufficient the growth of cities has gone on beyond comparison faster than the growth of the country and the upbuilding of the great industrial centers has meant a startling increase not merely in the aggregate of wealth but in the number of very large individual and especially of very large corporate fortunes the creation of these great corporate fortunes has not been due to the tariff nor to any other governmental action but to natural causes in the business world operating in other countries as they operate in our own the process has aroused much antagonism a great part of which is wholly without warrant it is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have grown poorer on the contrary never before has the average man the wage worker the farmer the small trader been so well off as in this country and at the present time there have been abuses connected with the accumulation of wealth yet it remains true that a fortune accumulated in legitimate business can be accumulated by the person specially benefited only on condition of conferring immense incidental benefits upon others successful enterprise of the type which benefits all mankind can only exist if the conditions are such as to offer great prizes as the rewards of success the captains of industry who have driven the railway systems across this continent who have built up our commerce who have developed our manufactures have on the whole done great good to our people without them the material development of which we are so justly proud could never have taken place moreover we should recognize the immense importance of this material development of leaving as unhampered as is compatible with the public good the strong and forceful men upon whom the success of business operations inevitably rests the slightest study of business conditions will satisfy anyone capable of forming a judgment that the personal equation is the most important factor in a business operation that the business ability of the man at the head of any business concern big or little is usually the factor which fixes the gulf between striking success and hopeless failure an additional reason for caution in dealing with corporations is to be found in the international commercial conditions of to day the same business conditions which have produced the great aggregations of corporate and individual wealth have made them very potent factors in international commercial competition business concerns which have the largest means at their disposal and are managed by the ablest men are naturally those which take the lead in the strife for commercial supremacy among the nations of the world america has only just begun to assume that commanding position in the international business world which we believe will more and more be hers it is of the utmost importance that this position be not jeoparded especially at a time when the overflowing abundance of our own natural resources and the skill business energy and mechanical aptitude of our people make foreign markets essential under such conditions it would be most unwise to cramp or to fetter the youthful strength of our nation moreover it cannot too often be pointed out that to strike with ignorant violence at the interests of one set of men almost inevitably endangers the interests of all the fundamental rule in our national life the rule which underlies all others is that on the whole and in the long run we shall go up or down together there are exceptions and in times of prosperity some will prosper far more and in times of adversity some will suffer far more than others but speaking generally a period of good times means that all share more or less in them and in a period of hard times all feel the stress to a greater or less degree it surely ought not to be necessary to enter into any proof of this statement the memory of the lean years which began in 1893 is still vivid and we can contrast them with the conditions in this very year which is now closing disaster to great business enterprises can never have its effects limited to the men at the top it spreads throughout and while it is bad for everybody it is worst for those farthest down the capitalist may be shorn of his luxuries but the wage worker may be deprived of even bare necessities the mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must be taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance many of those who have made it their vocation to denounce the great industrial combinations which are popularly although with technical inaccuracy known as trusts appeal especially to hatred and fear these are precisely the two emotions particularly when combined with ignorance which unfit men for the exercise of cool and steady judgment in facing new industrial conditions the whole history of the world shows that legislation will generally be both unwise and ineffective unless undertaken after calm inquiry and with sober self restraint much of the legislation directed at the trusts would have been exceedingly mischievous had it not also been entirely ineffective in accordance with a well known sociological law the ignorant or reckless agitator has been the really effective friend of the evils which he has been nominally opposing in dealing with business interests for the government to undertake by crude and ill considered legislation to do what may turn out to be bad would be to incur the risk of such far reaching national disaster that it would be preferable to undertake nothing at all the men who demand the impossible or the undesirable serve as the allies of the forces with which they are nominally at war for they hamper those who would endeavor to find out in rational fashion what the wrongs really are and to what extent and in what manner it is practicable to apply remedies all this is true and yet it is also true that there are real and grave evils one of the chief being over capitalization because of its many baleful consequences and a resolute and practical effort must be made to correct these evils there is a widespread conviction in the minds of the american people that the great corporations known as trusts are in certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare this springs from no spirit of envy or uncharitableness nor lack of pride in the great industrial achievements that have placed this country at the head of the nations struggling for commercial supremacy it does not rest upon a lack of intelligent appreciation of the necessity of meeting changing and changed conditions of trade with new methods nor upon ignorance of the fact that combination of capital in the effort to accomplish great things is necessary when the world s progress demands that great things be done it is based upon sincere conviction that combination and concentration should be not prohibited but supervised and within reasonable limits controlled and in my judgment this conviction is right it is no limitation upon property rights or freedom of contract to require that when men receive from government the privilege of doing business under corporate form which frees them from individual responsibility and enables them to call into their enterprises the capital of the public they shall do so upon absolutely truthful representations as to the value of the property in which the capital is to be invested corporations engaged in interstate commerce should be regulated if they are found to exercise a license working to the public injury it should be as much the aim of those who seek for social betterment to rid the business world of crimes of cunning as to rid the entire body politic of crimes of violence great corporations exist only because they are created and safeguarded by our institutions and it is therefore our right and our duty to see that they work in harmony with these institutions the first essential in determining how to deal with the great industrial combinations is knowledge of the facts publicity in the interest of the public the government should have the right to inspect and examine the workings of the great corporations engaged in interstate business publicity is the only sure remedy which we can now invoke what further remedies are needed in the way of governmental regulation or taxation can only be determined after publicity has been obtained by process of law and in the course of administration the first requisite is knowledge full and complete knowledge which may be made public to the world artificial bodies such as corporations and joint stock or other associations depending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges should be subject to proper governmental supervision and full and accurate information as to their operations should be made public regularly at reasonable intervals the large corporations commonly called trusts though organized in one state always do business in many states often doing very little business in the state where they are incorporated there is utter lack of uniformity in the state laws about them and as no state has any exclusive interest in or power over their acts it has in practice proved impossible to get adequate regulation through state action therefore in the interest of the whole people the nation should without interfering with the power of the states in the matter itself also assume power of supervision and regulation over all corporations doing an interstate business this is especially true where the corporation derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some monopolistic element or tendency in its business there would be no hardship in such supervision banks are subject to it and in their case it is now accepted as a simple matter of course indeed it is probable that supervision of corporations by the national government need not go so far as is now the case with the supervision exercised over them by so conservative a state as massachusetts in order to produce excellent results when the constitution was adopted at the end of the eighteenth century no human wisdom could foretell the sweeping changes alike in industrial and political conditions which were to take place by the beginning of the twentieth century at that time it was accepted as a matter of course that the several states were the proper authorities to regulate so far as was then necessary the comparatively insignificant and strictly localized corporate bodies of the day the conditions are now wholly different and wholly different action is called for i believe that a law can be framed which will enable the national government to exercise control along the lines above indicated profiting by the experience gained through the passage and administration of the interstate commerce act if however the judgment of the congress is that it lacks the constitutional power to pass such an act then a constitutional amendment should be submitted to confer the power there should be created a cabinet officer to be known as secretary of commerce and industries as provided in the bill introduced at the last session of the congress it should be his province to deal with commerce in its broadest sense including among many other things whatever concerns labor and all matters affecting the great business corporations and our merchant marine the course proposed is one phase of what should be a comprehensive and far reaching scheme of constructive statesmanship for the purpose of broadening our markets securing our business interests on a safe basis and making firm our new position in the international industrial world while scrupulously safeguarding the rights of wage worker and capitalist of investor and private citizen so as to secure equity as between man and man in this republic with the sole exception of the farming interest no one matter is of such vital moment to our whole people as the welfare of the wage workers if the farmer and the wage worker are well off it is absolutely certain that all others will be well off too it is therefore a matter for hearty congratulation that on the whole wages are higher to day in the united states than ever before in our history and far higher than in any other country the standard of living is also higher than ever before every effort of legislator and administrator should be bent to secure the permanency of this condition of things and its improvement wherever possible not only must our labor be protected by the tariff but it should also be protected so far as it is possible from the presence in this country of any laborers brought over by contract or of those who coming freely yet represent a standard of living so depressed that they can undersell our men in the labor market and drag them to a lower level i regard it as necessary with this end in view to re enact immediately the law excluding chinese laborers and to strengthen it wherever necessary in order to make its enforcement entirely effective the national government should demand the highest quality of service from its employees and in return it should be a good employer if possible legislation should be passed in connection with the interstate commerce law which will render effective the efforts of different states to do away with the competition of convict contract labor in the open labor market so far as practicable under the conditions of government work provision should be made to render the enforcement of the eight hour law easy and certain in all industries carried on directly or indirectly for the united states government women and children should be protected from excessive hours of labor from night work and from work under unsanitary conditions the government should provide in its contracts that all work should be done under fair conditions and in addition to setting a high standard should uphold it by proper inspection extending if necessary to the subcontractors the government should forbid all night work for women and children as well as excessive overtime for the district of columbia a good factory law should be passed and as a powerful indirect aid to such laws provision should be made to turn the inhabited alleys the existence of which is a reproach to our capital city into minor streets where the inhabitants can live under conditions favorable to health and morals american wage workers work with their heads as well as their hands moreover they take a keen pride in what they are doing so that independent of the reward they wish to turn out a perfect job this is the great secret of our success in competition with the labor of foreign countries the most vital problem with which this country and for that matter the whole civilized world has to deal is the problem which has for one side the betterment of social conditions moral and physical in large cities and for another side the effort to deal with that tangle of far reaching questions which we group together when we speak of labor the chief factor in the success of each man wage worker farmer and capitalist alike must ever be the sum total of his own individual qualities and abilities second only to this comes the power of acting in combination or association with others very great good has been and will be accomplished by associations or unions of wage workers when managed with forethought and when they combine insistence upon their own rights with law abiding respect for the rights of others the display of these qualities in such bodies is a duty to the nation no less than to the associations themselves finally there must also in many cases be action by the government in order to safeguard the rights and interests of all under our constitution there is much more scope for such action by the state and the municipality than by the nation but on points such as those touched on above the national government can act when all is said and done the rule of brotherhood remains as the indispensable prerequisite to success in the kind of national life for which we strive each man must work for himself and unless he so works no outside help can avail him but each man must remember also that he is indeed his brother s keeper and that while no man who refuses to walk can be carried with advantage to himself or anyone else yet that each at times stumbles or halts that each at times needs to have the helping hand outstretched to him to be permanently effective aid must always take the form of helping a man to help himself and we can all best help ourselves by joining together in the work that is of common interest to all our present immigration laws are unsatisfactory we need every honest and efficient immigrant fitted to become an american citizen every immigrant who comes here to stay who brings here a strong body a stout heart a good head and a resolute purpose to do his duty well in every way and to bring up his children as law abiding and god fearing members of the community but there should be a comprehensive law enacted with the object of working a threefold improvement over our present system first we should aim to exclude absolutely not only all persons who are known to be believers in anarchistic principles or members of anarchistic societies but also all persons who are of a low moral tendency or of unsavory reputation this means that we should require a more thorough system of inspection abroad and a more rigid system of examination at our immigration ports the former being especially necessary the second object of a proper immigration law ought to be to secure by a careful and not merely perfunctory educational test some intelligent capacity to appreciate american institutions and act sanely as american citizens this would not keep out all anarchists for many of them belong to the intelligent criminal class but it would do what is also in point that is tend to decrease the sum of ignorance so potent in producing the envy suspicion malignant passion and hatred of order out of which anarchistic sentiment inevitably springs finally all persons should be excluded who are below a certain standard of economic fitness to enter our industrial field as competitors with american labor there should be proper proof of personal capacity to earn an american living and enough money to insure a decent start under american conditions this would stop the influx of cheap labor and the resulting competition which gives rise to so much of bitterness in american industrial life and it would dry up the springs of the pestilential social conditions in our great cities where anarchistic organizations have their greatest possibility of growth both the educational and economic tests in a wise immigration law should be designed to protect and elevate the general body politic and social a very close supervision should be exercised over the steamship companies which mainly bring over the immigrants and they should be held to a strict accountability for any infraction of the law there is general acquiescence in our present tariff system as a national policy the first requisite to our prosperity is the continuity and stability of this economic policy nothing could be more unwise than to disturb the business interests of the country by any general tariff change at this time doubt apprehension uncertainty are exactly what we most wish to avoid in the interest of our commercial and material well being our experience in the past has shown that sweeping revisions of the tariff are apt to produce conditions closely approaching panic in the business world yet it is not only possible but eminently desirable to combine with the stability of our economic system a supplementary system of reciprocal benefit and obligation with other nations such reciprocity is an incident and result of the firm establishment and preservation of our present economic policy it was specially provided for in the present tariff law reciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection our first duty is to see that the protection granted by the tariff in every case where it is needed is maintained and that reciprocity be sought for so far as it can safely be done without injury to our home industries just how far this is must be determined according to the individual case remembering always that every application of our tariff policy to meet our shifting national needs must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must never be reduced below the point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad the well being of the wage worker is a prime consideration of our entire policy of economic legislation subject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our industrial well being at home the principle of reciprocity must command our hearty support the phenomenal growth of our export trade emphasizes the urgency of the need for wider markets and for a liberal policy in dealing with foreign nations whatever is merely petty and vexatious in the way of trade restrictions should be avoided the customers to whom we dispose of our surplus products in the long run directly or indirectly purchase those surplus products by giving us something in return their ability to purchase our products should as far as possible be secured by so arranging our tariff as to enable us to take from them those products which we can use without harm to our own industries and labor or the use of which will be of marked benefit to us it is most important that we should maintain the high level of our present prosperity we have now reached the point in the development of our interests where we are not only able to supply our own markets but to produce a constantly growing surplus for which we must find markets abroad to secure these markets we can utilize existing duties in any case where they are no longer needed for the purpose of protection or in any case where the article is not produced here and the duty is no longer necessary for revenue as giving us something to offer in exchange for what we ask the cordial relations with other nations which are so desirable will naturally be promoted by the course thus required by our own interests the natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be in connection with those of our productions which no longer require all of the support once needed to establish them upon a sound basis and with those others where either because of natural or of economic causes we are beyond the reach of successful competition i ask the attention of the senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before it by my predecessor the condition of the american merchant marine is such as to call for immediate remedial action by the congress it is discreditable to us as a nation that our merchant marine should be utterly insignificant in comparison to that of other nations which we overtop in other forms of business we should not longer submit to conditions under which only a trifling portion of our great commerce is carried in our own ships to remedy this state of things would not merely serve to build up our shipping interests but it would also result in benefit to all who are interested in the permanent establishment of a wider market for american products and would provide an auxiliary force for the navy ships work for their own countries just as railroads work for their terminal points shipping lines if established to the principal countries with which we have dealings would be of political as well as commercial benefit from every standpoint it is unwise for the united states to continue to rely upon the ships of competing nations for the distribution of our goods it should be made advantageous to carry american goods in american built ships at present american shipping is under certain great disadvantages when put in competition with the shipping of foreign countries many of the fast foreign steamships at a speed of fourteen knots or above are subsidized and all our ships sailing vessels and steamers alike cargo carriers of slow speed and mail carriers of high speed have to meet the fact that the original cost of building american ships is greater than is the case abroad that the wages paid american officers and seamen are very much higher than those paid the officers and seamen of foreign competing countries and that the standard of living on our ships is far superior to the standard of living on the ships of our commercial rivals our government should take such action as will remedy these inequalities the american merchant marine should be restored to the ocean the act of march 14 1900 intended unequivocally to establish gold as the standard money and to maintain at a parity therewith all forms of money medium in use with us has been shown to be timely and judicious the price of our government bonds in the world s market when compared with the price of similar obligations issued by other nations is a flattering tribute to our public credit this condition it is evidently desirable to maintain in many respects the national banking law furnishes sufficient liberty for the proper exercise of the banking function but there seems to be need of better safeguards against the deranging influence of commercial crises and financial panics moreover the currency of the country should be made responsive to the demands of our domestic trade and commerce the collections from duties on imports and internal taxes continue to exceed the ordinary expenditures of the government thanks mainly to the reduced army expenditures the utmost care should be taken not to reduce the revenues so that there will be any possibility of a deficit but after providing against any such contingency means should be adopted which will bring the revenues more nearly within the limit of our actual needs in his report to the congress the secretary of the treasury considers all these questions at length and i ask your attention to the report and recommendations i call special attention to the need of strict economy in expenditures the fact that our national needs forbid us to be niggardly in providing whatever is actually necessary to our well being should make us doubly careful to husband our national resources as each of us husbands his private resources by scrupulous avoidance of anything like wasteful or reckless expenditure only by avoidance of spending money on what is needless or unjustifiable can we legitimately keep our income to the point required to meet our needs that are genuine in 1887 a measure was enacted for the regulation of interstate railways commonly known as the interstate commerce act the cardinal provisions of that act were that railway rates should be just and reasonable and that all shippers localities and commodities should be accorded equal treatment a commission was created and endowed with what were supposed to be the necessary powers to execute the provisions of this act that law was largely an experiment experience has shown the wisdom of its purposes but has also shown possibly that some of its requirements are wrong certainly that the means devised for the enforcement of its provisions are defective those who complain of the management of the railways allege that established rates are not maintained that rebates and similar devices are habitually resorted to that these preferences are usually in favor of the large shipper that they drive out of business the smaller competitor that while many rates are too low many others are excessive and that gross preferences are made affecting both localities and commodities upon the other hand the railways assert that the law by its very terms tends to produce many of these illegal practices by depriving carriers of that right of concerted action which they claim is necessary to establish and maintain non discriminating rates the act should be amended the railway is a public servant its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike the government should see to it that within its jurisdiction this is so and should provide a speedy inexpensive and effective remedy to that end at the same time it must not be forgotten that our railways are the arteries through which the commercial lifeblood of this nation flows nothing could be more foolish than the enactment of legislation which would unnecessarily interfere with the development and operation of these commercial agencies the subject is one of great importance and calls for the earnest attention of the congress the department of agriculture during the past fifteen years has steadily broadened its work on economic lines and has accomplished results of real value in upbuilding domestic and foreign trade it has gone into new fields until it is now in touch with all sections of our country and with two of the island groups that have lately come under our jurisdiction whose people must look to agriculture as a livelihood it is searching the world for grains grasses fruits and vegetables specially fitted for introduction into localities in the several states and territories where they may add materially to our resources by scientific attention to soil survey and possible new crops to breeding of new varieties of plants to experimental shipments to animal industry and applied chemistry very practical aid has been given our farming and stock growing interests the products of the farm have taken an unprecedented place in our export trade during the year that has just closed public opinion throughout the united states has moved steadily toward a just appreciation of the value of forests whether planted or of natural growth the great part played by them in the creation and maintenance of the national wealth is now more fully realized than ever before wise forest protection does not mean the withdrawal of forest resources whether of wood water or grass from contributing their full share to the welfare of the people but on the contrary gives the assurance of larger and more certain supplies the fundamental idea of forestry is the perpetuation of forests by use forest protection is not an end of itself it is a means to increase and sustain the resources of our country and the industries which depend upon them the preservation of our forests is an imperative business necessity we have come to see clearly that whatever destroys the forest except to make way for agriculture threatens our well being the practical usefulness of the national forest reserves to the mining grazing irrigation and other interests of the regions in which the reserves lie has led to a widespread demand by the people of the west for their protection and extension the forest reserves will inevitably be of still greater use in the future than in the past additions should be made to them whenever practicable and their usefulness should be increased by a thoroughly business like management at present the protection of the forest reserves rests with the general land office the mapping and description of their timber with the united states geological survey and the preparation of plans for their conservative use with the bureau of forestry which is also charged with the general advancement of practical forestry in the united states these various functions should be united in the bureau of forestry to which they properly belong the present diffusion of responsibility is bad from every standpoint it prevents that effective co operation between the government and the men who utilize the resources of the reserves without which the interests of both must suffer the scientific bureaus generally should be put under the department of agriculture the president should have by law the power of transferring lands for use as forest reserves to the department of agriculture he already has such power in the case of lands needed by the departments of war and the navy the wise administration of the forest reserves will be not less helpful to the interests which depend on water than to those which depend on wood and grass the water supply itself depends upon the forest in the arid region it is water not land which measures production the western half of the united states would sustain a population greater than that of our whole country to day if the waters that now run to waste were saved and used for irrigation the forest and water problems are perhaps the most vital internal questions of the united states certain of the forest reserves should also be made preserves for the wild forest creatures all of the reserves should be better protected from fires many of them need special protection because of the great injury done by live stock above all by sheep the increase in deer elk and other animals in the yellowstone park shows what may be expected when other mountain forests are properly protected by law and properly guarded some of these areas have been so denuded of surface vegetation by overgrazing that the ground breeding birds including grouse and quail and many mammals including deer have been exterminated or driven away at the same time the water storing capacity of the surface has been decreased or destroyed thus promoting floods in times of rain and diminishing the flow of streams between rains in cases where natural conditions have been restored for a few years vegetation has again carpeted the ground birds and deer are coming back and hundreds of persons especially from the immediate neighborhood come each summer to enjoy the privilege of camping some at least of the forest reserves should afford perpetual protection to the native fauna and flora safe havens of refuge to our rapidly diminishing wild animals of the larger kinds and free camping grounds for the ever increasing numbers of men and women who have learned to find rest health and recreation in the splendid forests and flower clad meadows of our mountains the forest reserves should be set apart forever for the use and benefit of our people as a whole and not sacrificed to the shortsighted greed of a few the forests are natural reservoirs by restraining the streams in flood and replenishing them in drought they make possible the use of waters otherwise wasted they prevent the soil from washing and so protect the storage reservoirs from filling up with silt forest conservation is therefore an essential condition of water conservation the forests alone cannot however fully regulate and conserve the waters of the arid region great storage works are necessary to equalize the flow of streams and to save the flood waters their construction has been conclusively shown to be an undertaking too vast for private effort nor can it be best accomplished by the individual states acting alone far reaching interstate problems are involved and the resources of single states would often be inadequate it is properly a national function at least in some of its features it is as right for the national government to make the streams and rivers of the arid region useful by engineering works for water storage as to make useful the rivers and harbors of the humid region by engineering works of another kind the storing of the floods in reservoirs at the headwaters of our rivers is but an enlargement of our present policy of river control under which levees are built on the lower reaches of the same streams the government should construct and maintain these reservoirs as it does other public works where their purpose is to regulate the flow of streams the water should be turned freely into the channels in the dry season to take the same course under the same laws as the natural flow the reclamation of the unsettled arid public lands presents a different problem here it is not enough to regulate the flow of streams the object of the government is to dispose of the land to settlers who will build homes upon it to accomplish this object water must be brought within their reach the pioneer settlers on the arid public domain chose their homes along streams from which they could themselves divert the water to reclaim their holdings such opportunities are practically gone there remain however vast areas of public land which can be made available for homestead settlement but only by reservoirs and main line canals impracticable for private enterprise these irrigation works should be built by the national government the lands reclaimed by them should be reserved by the government for actual settlers and the cost of construction should so far as possible be repaid by the land reclaimed the distribution of the water the division of the streams among irrigators should be left to the settlers themselves in conformity with state laws and without interference with those laws or with vested fights the policy of the national government should be to aid irrigation in the several states and territories in such manner as will enable the people in the local communities to help themselves and as will stimulate needed reforms in the state laws and regulations governing irrigation the reclamation and settlement of the arid lands will enrich every portion of our country just as the settlement of the ohio and mississippi valleys brought prosperity to the atlantic states the increased demand for manufactured articles will stimulate industrial production while wider home markets and the trade of asia will consume the larger food supplies and effectually prevent western competition with eastern agriculture indeed the products of irrigation will be consumed chiefly in upbuilding local centers of mining and other industries which would otherwise not come into existence at all our people as a whole will profit for successful home making is but another name for the upbuilding of the nation the necessary foundation has already been laid for the inauguration of the policy just described it would be unwise to begin by doing too much for a great deal will doubtless be learned both as to what can and what cannot be safely attempted by the early efforts which must of necessity be partly experimental in character at the very beginning the government should make clear beyond shadow of doubt its intention to pursue this policy on lines of the broadest public interest no reservoir or canal should ever be built to satisfy selfish personal or local interests but only in accordance with the advice of trained experts after long investigation has shown the locality where all the conditions combine to make the work most needed and fraught with the greatest usefulness to the community as a whole there should be no extravagance and the believers in the need of irrigation will most benefit their cause by seeing to it that it is free from the least taint of excessive or reckless expenditure of the public moneys whatever the nation does for the extension of irrigation should harmonize with and tend to improve the condition of those now living on irrigated land we are not at the starting point of this development over two hundred millions of private capital has already been expended in the construction of irrigation works and many million acres of arid land reclaimed a high degree of enterprise and ability has been shown in the work itself but as much cannot be said in reference to the laws relating thereto the security and value of the homes created depend largely on the stability of titles to water but the majority of these rest on the uncertain foundation of court decisions rendered in ordinary suits at law with a few creditable exceptions the arid states have failed to provide for the certain and just division of streams in times of scarcity lax and uncertain laws have made it possible to establish rights to water in excess of actual uses or necessities and many streams have already passed into private ownership or a control equivalent to ownership whoever controls a stream practically controls the land it renders productive and the doctrine of private ownership of water apart from land cannot prevail without causing enduring wrong the recognition of such ownership which has been permitted to grow up in the arid regions should give way to a more enlightened and larger recognition of the rights of the public in the control and disposal of the public water supplies laws founded upon conditions obtaining in humid regions where water is too abundant to justify hoarding it have no proper application in a dry country in the arid states the only right to water which should be recognized is that of use in irrigation this right should attach to the land reclaimed and be inseparable therefrom granting perpetual water rights to others than users without compensation to the public is open to all the objections which apply to giving away perpetual franchises to the public utilities of cities a few of the western states have already recognized this and have incorporated in their constitutions the doctrine of perpetual state ownership of water the benefits which have followed the unaided development of the past justify the nation s aid and co operation in the more difficult and important work yet to be accomplished laws so vitally affecting homes as those which control the water supply will only be effective when they have the sanction of the irrigators reforms can only be final and satisfactory when they come through the enlightenment of the people most concerned the larger development which national aid insures should however awaken in every arid state the determination to make its irrigation system equal in justice and effectiveness that of any country in the civilized world nothing could be more unwise than for isolated communities to continue to learn everything experimentally instead of profiting by what is already known elsewhere we are dealing with a new and momentous question in the pregnant years while institutions are forming and what we do will affect not only the present but future generations our aim should be not simply to reclaim the largest area of land and provide homes for the largest number of people but to create for this new industry the best possible social and industrial conditions and this requires that we not only understand the existing situation but avail ourselves of the best experience of the time in the solution of its problems a careful study should be made both by the nation and the states of the irrigation laws and conditions here and abroad ultimately it will probably be necessary for the nation to co operate with the several arid states in proportion as these states by their legislation and administration show themselves fit to receive it in hawaii our aim must be to develop the territory on the traditional american lines we do not wish a region of large estates tilled by cheap labor we wish a healthy american community of men who themselves till the farms they own all our legislation for the islands should be shaped with this end in view the well being of the average home maker must afford the true test of the healthy development of the islands the land policy should as nearly as possible be modeled on our homestead system it is a pleasure to say that it is hardly more necessary to report as to puerto rico than as to any state or territory within our continental limits the island is thriving as never before and it is being administered efficiently and honestly its people are now enjoying liberty and order under the protection of the united states and upon this fact we congratulate them and ourselves their material welfare must be as carefully and jealously considered as the welfare of any other portion of our country we have given them the great gift of free access for their products to the markets of the united states i ask the attention of the congress to the need of legislation concerning the public lands of puerto rico in cuba such progress has been made toward putting the independent government of the island upon a firm footing that before the present session of the congress closes this will be an accomplished fact cuba will then start as her own mistress and to the beautiful queen of the antilles as she unfolds this new page of her destiny we extend our heartiest greetings and good wishes elsewhere i have discussed the question of reciprocity in the case of cuba however there are weighty reasons of morality and of national interest why the policy should be held to have a peculiar application and i most earnestly ask your attention to the wisdom indeed to the vital need of providing for a substantial reduction in the tariff duties on cuban imports into the united states cuba has in her constitution affirmed what we desired that she should stand in international matters in closer and more friendly relations with us than with any other power and we are bound by every consideration of honor and expediency to pass commercial measures in the interest of her material well being in the philippines our problem is larger they are very rich tropical islands inhabited by many varying tribes representing widely different stages of progress toward civilization our earnest effort is to help these people upward along the stony and difficult path that leads to self government we hope to make our administration of the islands honorable to our nation by making it of the highest benefit to the filipinos themselves and as an earnest of what we intend to do we point to what we have done already a greater measure of material prosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency has been attained in the philippines than ever before in their history it is no light task for a nation to achieve the temperamental qualities without which the institutions of free government are but an empty mockery our people are now successfully governing themselves because for more than a thousand years they have been slowly fitting themselves sometimes consciously sometimes unconsciously toward this end what has taken us thirty generations to achieve we cannot expect to have another race accomplish out of hand especially when large portions of that race start very far behind the point which our ancestors had reached even thirty generations ago in dealing with the philippine people we must show both patience and strength forbearance and steadfast resolution our aim is high we do not desire to do for the islanders merely what has elsewhere been done for tropic peoples by even the best foreign governments we hope to do for them what has never before been done for any people of the tropics to make them fit for self government after the fashion of the really free nations history may safely be challenged to show a single instance in which a masterful race such as ours having been forced by the exigencies of war to take possession of an alien land has behaved to its inhabitants with the disinterested zeal for their progress that our people have shown in the philippines to leave the islands at this time would mean that they would fall into a welter of murderous anarchy such desertion of duty on our part would be a crime against humanity the character of governor taft and of his associates and subordinates is a proof if such be needed of the sincerity of our effort to give the islanders a constantly increasing measure of self government exactly as fast as they show themselves fit to exercise it since the civil government was established not an appointment has been made in the islands with any reference to considerations of political influence or to aught else save the fitness of the man and the needs of the service in our anxiety for the welfare and progress of the philippines may be that here and there we have gone too rapidly in giving them local self government it is on this side that our error if any has been committed no competent observer sincerely desirous of finding out the facts and influenced only by a desire for the welfare of the natives can assert that we have not gone far enough we have gone to the very verge of safety in hastening the process to have taken a single step farther or faster in advance would have been folly and weakness and might well have been crime we are extremely anxious that the natives shall show the power of governing themselves we are anxious first for their sakes and next because it relieves us of a great burden there need not be the slightest fear of our not continuing to give them all the liberty for which they are fit the only fear is test in our overanxiety we give them a degree of independence for which they are unfit thereby inviting reaction and disaster as fast as there is any reasonable hope that in a given district the people can govern themselves self government has been given in that district there is not a locality fitted for self government which has not received it but it may well be that in certain cases it will have to be withdrawn because the inhabitants show themselves unfit to exercise it such instances have already occurred in other words there is not the slightest chance of our failing to show a sufficiently humanitarian spirit the danger comes in the opposite direction there are still troubles ahead in the islands the insurrection has become an affair of local banditti and marauders who deserve no higher regard than the brigands of portions of the old world encouragement direct or indirect to these insurrectors stands on the same footing as encouragement to hostile indians in the days when we still had indian wars exactly as our aim is to give to the indian who remains peaceful the fullest and amplest consideration but to have it understood that we will show no weakness if he goes on the warpath so we must make it evident unless we are false to our own traditions and to the demands of civilization and humanity that while we will do everything in our power for the filipino who is peaceful we will take the sternest measures with the filipino who follows the path of the insurrecto and the ladrone the heartiest praise is due to large numbers of the natives of the islands for their steadfast loyalty the macabebes have been conspicuous for their courage and devotion to the flag i recommend that the secretary of war be empowered to take some systematic action in the way of aiding those of these men who are crippled in the service and the families of those who are killed the time has come when there should be additional legislation for the philippines nothing better can be done for the islands than to introduce industrial enterprises nothing would benefit them so much as throwing them open to industrial development the connection between idleness and mischief is proverbial and the opportunity to do remunerative work is one of the surest preventatives of war of course no business man will go into the philippines unless it is to his interest to do so and it is immensely to the interest of the islands that he should go in it is therefore necessary that the congress should pass laws by which the resources of the islands can be developed so that franchises for limited terms of years can be granted to companies doing business in them and every encouragement be given to the incoming of business men of every kind not to permit this is to do a wrong to the philippines the franchises must be granted and the business permitted only under regulations which will guarantee the islands against any kind of improper exploitation but the vast natural wealth of the islands must be developed and the capital willing to develop it must be given the opportunity the field must be thrown open to individual enterprise which has been the real factor in the development of every region over which our flag has flown it is urgently necessary to enact suitable laws dealing with general transportation mining banking currency homesteads and the use and ownership of the lands and timber these laws will give free play to industrial enterprise and the commercial development which will surely follow will accord to the people of the islands the best proofs of the sincerity of our desire to aid them i call your attention most earnestly to the crying need of a cable to hawaii and the philippines to be continued from the philippines to points in asia we should not defer a day longer than necessary the construction of such a cable it is demanded not merely for commercial but for political and military considerations either the congress should immediately provide for the construction of a government cable or else an arrangement should be made by which like advantages to those accruing from a government cable may be secured to the government by contract with a private cable company no single great material work which remains to be undertaken on this continent is of such consequence to the american people as the building of a canal across the isthmus connecting north and south america its importance to the nation is by no means limited merely to its material effects upon our business prosperity and yet with view to these effects alone it would be to the last degree important for us immediately to begin it while its beneficial effects would perhaps be most marked upon the pacific coast and the gulf and south atlantic states it would also greatly benefit other sections it is emphatically a work which it is for the interest of the entire country to begin and complete as soon as possible it is one of those great works which only a great nation can undertake with prospects of success and which when done are not only permanent assets in the nation s material interests but standing monuments to its constructive ability i am glad to be able to announce to you that our negotiations on this subject with great britain conducted on both sides in a spirit of friendliness and mutual good will and respect have resulted in my being able to lay before the senate a treaty which if ratified will enable us to begin preparations for an isthmian canal at any time and which guarantees to this nation every right that it has ever asked in connection with the canal in this treaty the old clayton bulwer treaty so long recognized as inadequate to supply the base for the construction and maintenance of a necessarily american ship canal is abrogated it specifically provides that the united states alone shall do the work of building and assume the responsibility of safeguarding the canal and shall regulate its neutral use by all nations on terms of equality without the guaranty or interference of any outside nation from any quarter the signed treaty will at once be laid before the senate and if approved the congress can then proceed to give effect to the advantages it secures us by providing for the building of the canal the true end of every great and free people should be self respecting peace and this nation most earnestly desires sincere and cordial friendship with all others over the entire world of recent years wars between the great civilized powers have become less and less frequent wars with barbarous or semi barbarous peoples come in an entirely different category being merely a most regrettable but necessary international police duty which must be performed for the sake of the welfare of mankind peace can only be kept with certainty where both sides wish to keep it but more and more the civilized peoples are realizing the wicked folly of war and are attaining that condition of just and intelligent regard for the rights of others which will in the end as we hope and believe make world wide peace possible the peace conference at the hague gave definite expression to this hope and belief and marked a stride toward their attainment this same peace conference acquiesced in our statement of the monroe doctrine as compatible with the purposes and aims of the conference the monroe doctrine should be the cardinal feature of the foreign policy of all the nations of the two americas as it is of the united states just seventy eight years have passed since president monroe in his annual message announced that the american continents are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any european power in other words the monroe doctrine is a declaration that there must be no territorial aggrandizement by any non american power at the expense of any american power on american soil it is in no wise intended as hostile to any nation in the old world still less is it intended to give cover to any aggression by one new world power at the expense of any other it is simply a step and a long step toward assuring the universal peace of the world by securing the possibility of permanent peace on this hemisphere during the past century other influences have established the permanence and independence of the smaller states of europe through the monroe doctrine we hope to be able to safeguard like independence and secure like permanence for the lesser among the new world nations this doctrine has nothing to do with the commercial relations of any american power save that it in truth allows each of them to form such as it desires in other words it is really a guaranty of the commercial independence of the americas we do not ask under this doctrine for any exclusive commercial dealings with any other american state we do not guarantee any state against punishment if it misconducts itself provided that punishment does not take the form of the acquisition of territory by any non american power our attitude in cuba is a sufficient guaranty of our own good faith we have not the slightest desire to secure any territory at the expense of any of our neighbors we wish to work with them hand in hand so that all of us may be uplifted together and we rejoice over the good fortune of any of them we gladly hail their material prosperity and political stability and are concerned and alarmed if any of them fall into industrial or political chaos we do not wish to see any old world military power grow up on this continent or to be compelled to become a military power ourselves the peoples of the americas can prosper best if left to work out their own salvation in their own way the work of upbuilding the navy must be steadily continued no one point of our policy foreign or domestic is more important than this to the honor and material welfare and above all to the peace of our nation in the future whether we desire it or not we must henceforth recognize that we have international duties no less than international rights even if our flag were hauled down in the philippines and puerto rico even if we decided not to build the isthmian canal we should need a thoroughly trained navy of adequate size or else be prepared definitely and for all time to abandon the idea that our nation is among those whose sons go down to the sea in ships unless our commerce is always to be carried in foreign bottoms we must have war craft to protect it inasmuch however as the american people have no thought of abandoning the path upon which they have entered and especially in view of the fact that the building of the isthmian canal is fast becoming one of the matters which the whole people are united in demanding it is imperative that our navy should be put and kept in the highest state of efficiency and should be made to answer to our growing needs so far from being in any way a provocation to war an adequate and highly trained navy is the best guaranty against war the cheapest and most effective peace insurance the cost of building and maintaining such a navy represents the very lightest premium for insuring peace which this nation can possibly pay probably no other great nation in the world is so anxious for peace as we are there is not a single civilized power which has anything whatever to fear from aggressiveness on our part all we want is peace and toward this end we wish to be able to secure the same respect for our rights from others which we are eager and anxious to extend to their rights in return to insure fair treatment to us commercially and to guarantee the safety of the american people our people intend to abide by the monroe doctrine and to insist upon it as the one sure means of securing the peace of the western hemisphere the navy offers us the only means of making our insistence upon the monroe doctrine anything but a subject of derision to whatever nation chooses to disregard it we desire the peace which comes as of right to the just man armed not the peace granted on terms of ignominy to the craven and the weakling it is not possible to improvise a navy after war breaks out the ships must be built and the men trained long in advance some auxiliary vessels can be turned into makeshifts which will do in default of any better for the minor work and a proportion of raw men can be mixed with the highly trained their shortcomings being made good by the skill of their fellows but the efficient fighting force of the navy when pitted against an equal opponent will be found almost exclusively in the war ships that have been regularly built and in the officers and men who through years of faithful performance of sea duty have been trained to handle their formidable but complex and delicate weapons with the highest efficiency in the late war with spain the ships that dealt the decisive blows at manila and santiago had been launched from two to fourteen years and they were able to do as they did because the men in the conning towers the gun turrets and the engine rooms had through long years of practice at sea learned how to do their duty our present navy was begun in 1882 at that period our navy consisted of a collection of antiquated wooden ships already almost as out of place against modern war vessels as the galleys of alcibiades and hamilcar certainly as the ships of tromp and blake nor at that time did we have men fit to handle a modern man of war under the wise legislation of the congress and the successful administration of a succession of patriotic secretaries of the navy belonging to both political parties the work of upbuilding the navy went on and ships equal to any in the world of their kind were continually added and what was even more important these ships were exercised at sea singly and in squadrons until the men aboard them were able to get the best possible service out of them the result was seen in the short war with spain which was decided with such rapidity because of the infinitely greater preparedness of our navy than of the spanish navy while awarding the fullest honor to the men who actually commanded and manned the ships which destroyed the spanish sea forces in the philippines and in cuba we must not forget that an equal meed of praise belongs to those without whom neither blow could have been struck the congressmen who voted years in advance the money to lay down the ships to build the guns to buy the armor plate the department officials and the business men and wage workers who furnished what the congress had authorized the secretaries of the navy who asked for and expended the appropriations and finally the officers who in fair weather and foul on actual sea service trained and disciplined the crews of the ships when there was no war in sight all are entitled to a full share in the glory of manila and santiago and the respect accorded by every true american to those who wrought such signal triumph for our country it was forethought and preparation which secured us the overwhelming triumph of 1898 if we fail to show forethought and preparation now there may come a time when disaster will befall us instead of triumph and should this time come the fault will rest primarily not upon those whom the accident of events puts in supreme command at the moment but upon those who have failed to prepare in advance there should be no cessation in the work of completing our navy so far ingenuity has been wholly unable to devise a substitute for the great war craft whose hammering guns beat out the mastery of the high seas it is unsafe and unwise not to provide this year for several additional battle ships and heavy armored cruisers with auxiliary and lighter craft in proportion for the exact numbers and character i refer you to the report of the secretary of the navy but there is something we need even more than additional ships and this is additional officers and men to provide battle ships and cruisers and then lay them up with the expectation of leaving them unmanned until they are needed in actual war would be worse than folly it would be a crime against the nation to send any war ship against a competent enemy unless those aboard it have been trained by years of actual sea service including incessant gunnery practice would be to invite not merely disaster but the bitterest shame and humiliation four thousand additional seamen and one thousand additional marines should be provided and an increase in the officers should be provided by making a large addition to the classes at annapolis there is one small matter which should be mentioned in connection with annapolis the pretentious and unmeaning title of naval cadet should be abolished the title of midshipman full of historic association should be restored even in time of peace a war ship should be used until it wears out for only so can it be kept fit to respond to any emergency the officers and men alike should be kept as much as possible on blue water for it is there only they can learn their duties as they should be learned the big vessels should be manoeuvred in squadrons containing not merely battle ships but the necessary proportion of cruisers and scouts the torpedo boats should be handled by the younger officers in such manner as will best fit the latter to take responsibility and meet the emergencies of actual warfare every detail ashore which can be performed by a civilian should be so performed the officer being kept for his special duty in the sea service above all gunnery practice should be unceasing it is important to have our navy of adequate size but it is even more important that ship for ship it should equal in efficiency any navy in the world this is possible only with highly drilled crews and officers and this in turn imperatively demands continuous and progressive instruction in target practice ship handling squadron tactics and general discipline our ships must be assembled in squadrons actively cruising away from harbors and never long at anchor the resulting wear upon engines and hulls must be endured a battle ship worn out in long training of officers and men is well paid for by the results while on the other hand no matter in how excellent condition it is useless if the crew be not expert we now have seventeen battle ships appropriated for of which nine are completed and have been commissioned for actual service the remaining eight will be ready in from two to four years but it will take at least that time to recruit and train the men to fight them it is of vast concern that we have trained crews ready for the vessels by the time they are commissioned good ships and good guns are simply good weapons and the best weapons are useless save in the hands of men who know how to fight with them the men must be trained and drilled under a thorough and well planned system of progressive instruction while the recruiting must be carried on with still greater vigor every effort must be made to exalt the main function of the officer the command of men the leading graduates of the naval academy should be assigned to the combatant branches the line and marines many of the essentials of success are already recognized by the general board which as the central office of a growing staff is moving steadily toward a proper war efficiency and a proper efficiency of the whole navy under the secretary this general board by fostering the creation of a general staff is providing for the official and then the general recognition of our altered conditions as a nation and of the true meaning of a great war fleet which meaning is first the best men and second the best ships the naval militia forces are state organizations and are trained for coast service and in event of war they will constitute the inner line of defense they should receive hearty encouragement from the general government but in addition we should at once provide for a national naval reserve organized and trained under the direction of the navy department and subject to the call of the chief executive whenever war becomes imminent it should be a real auxiliary to the naval seagoing peace establishment and offer material to be drawn on at once for manning our ships in time of war it should be composed of graduates of the naval academy graduates of the naval militia officers and crews of coast line steamers longshore schooners fishing vessels and steam yachts together with the coast population about such centers as lifesaving stations and light houses the american people must either build and maintain an adequate navy or else make up their minds definitely to accept a secondary position in international affairs not merely in political but in commercial matters it has been well said that there is no surer way of courting national disaster than to be opulent aggressive and unarmed it is not necessary to increase our army beyond its present size at this time but it is necessary to keep it at the highest point of efficiency the individual units who as officers and enlisted men compose this army are we have good reason to believe at least as efficient as those of any other army in the entire world it is our duty to see that their training is of a kind to insure the highest possible expression of power to these units when acting in combination the conditions of modern war are such as to make an infinitely heavier demand than ever before upon the individual character and capacity of the officer and the enlisted man and to make it far more difficult for men to act together with effect at present the fighting must be done in extended order which means that each man must act for himself and at the same time act in combination with others with whom he is no longer in the old fashioned elbow to elbow touch under such conditions a few men of the highest excellence are worth more than many men without the special skill which is only found as the result of special training applied to men of exceptional physique and morale but nowadays the most valuable fighting man and the most difficult to perfect is the rifleman who is also a skillful and daring rider the proportion of our cavalry regiments has wisely been increased the american cavalryman trained to manoeuvre and fight with equal facility on foot and on horseback is the best type of soldier for general purposes now to be found in the world the ideal cavalryman of the present day is a man who can fight on foot as effectively as the best infantryman and who is in addition unsurpassed in the care and management of his horse and in his ability to fight on horseback a general staff should be created as for the present staff and supply departments they should be filled by details from the line the men so detailed returning after a while to their line duties it is very undesirable to have the senior grades of the army composed of men who have come to fill the positions by the mere fact of seniority a system should be adopted by which there shall be an elimination grade by grade of those who seem unfit to render the best service in the next grade justice to the veterans of the civil war who are still in the army would seem to require that in the matter of retirements they be given by law the same privileges accorded to their comrades in the navy the process of elimination of the least fit should be conducted in a manner that would render it practically impossible to apply political or social pressure on behalf of any candidate so that each man may be judged purely on his own merits pressure for the promotion of civil officials for political reasons is bad enough but it is tenfold worse where applied on behalf of officers of the army or navy every promotion and every detail under the war department must be made solely with regard to the good of the service and to the capacity and merit of the man himself no pressure political social or personal of any kind will be permitted to exercise the least effect in any question of promotion or detail and if there is reason to believe that such pressure is exercised at the instigation of the officer concerned it will be held to militate against him in our army we cannot afford to have rewards or duties distributed save on the simple ground that those who by their own merits are entitled to the rewards get them and that those who are peculiarly fit to do the duties are chosen to perform them every effort should be made to bring the army to a constantly increasing state of efficiency when on actual service no work save that directly in the line of such service should be required the paper work in the army as in the navy should be greatly reduced what is needed is proved power of command and capacity to work well in the field constant care is necessary to prevent dry rot in the transportation and commissary departments our army is so small and so much scattered that it is very difficult to give the higher officers as well as the lower officers and the enlisted men a chance to practice manoeuvres in mass and on a comparatively large scale in time of need no amount of individual excellence would avail against the paralysis which would follow inability to work as a coherent whole under skillful and daring leadership the congress should provide means whereby it will be possible to have field exercises by at least a division of regulars and if possible also a division of national guardsmen once a year these exercises might take the form of field manoeuvres or if on the gulf coast or the pacific or atlantic sea board or in the region of the great lakes the army corps when assembled could be marched from some inland point to some point on the water there embarked disembarked after a couple of days journey at some other point and again marched inland only by actual handling and providing for men in masses while they are marching camping embarking and disembarking will it be possible to train the higher officers to perform their duties well and smoothly a great debt is owing from the public to the men of the army and navy they should be so treated as to enable them to reach the highest point of efficiency so that they may be able to respond instantly to any demand made upon them to sustain the interests of the nation and the honor of the flag the individual american enlisted man is probably on the whole a more formidable fighting man than the regular of any other army every consideration should be shown him and in return the highest standard of usefulness should be exacted from him it is well worth while for the congress to consider whether the pay of enlisted men upon second and subsequent enlistments should not be increased to correspond with the increased value of the veteran soldier much good has already come from the act reorganizing the army passed early in the present year the three prime reforms all of them of literally inestimable value are first the substitution of four year details from the line for permanent appointments in the so called staff divisions second the establishment of a corps of artillery with a chief at the head third the establishment of a maximum and minimum limit for the army it would be difficult to overestimate the improvement in the efficiency of our army which these three reforms are making and have in part already effected the reorganization provided for by the act has been substantially accomplished the improved conditions in the philippines have enabled the war department materially to reduce the military charge upon our revenue and to arrange the number of soldiers so as to bring this number much nearer to the minimum than to the maximum limit established by law there is however need of supplementary legislation thorough military education must be provided and in addition to the regulars the advantages of this education should be given to the officers of the national guard and others in civil life who desire intelligently to fit themselves for possible military duty the officers should be given the chance to perfect themselves by study in the higher branches of this art at west point the education should be of the kind most apt to turn out men who are good in actual field service too much stress should not be laid on mathematics nor should proficiency therein be held to establish the right of entry to a corps d elite the typical american officer of the best kind need not be a good mathematician but he must be able to master himself to control others and to show boldness and fertility of resource in every emergency action should be taken in reference to the militia and to the raising of volunteer forces our militia law is obsolete and worthless the organization and armament of the national guard of the several states which are treated as militia in the appropriations by the congress should be made identical with those provided for the regular forces the obligations and duties of the guard in time of war should be carefully defined and a system established by law under which the method of procedure of raising volunteer forces should be prescribed in advance it is utterly impossible in the excitement and haste of impending war to do this satisfactorily if the arrangements have not been made long beforehand provision should be made for utilizing in the first volunteer organizations called out the training of those citizens who have already had experience under arms and especially for the selection in advance of the officers of any force which may be raised for careful selection of the kind necessary is impossible after the outbreak of war that the army is not at all a mere instrument of destruction has been shown during the last three years in the philippines cuba and puerto rico it has proved itself a great constructive force a most potent implement for the upbuilding of a peaceful civilization no other citizens deserve so well of the republic as the veterans the survivors of those who saved the union they did the one deed which if left undone would have meant that all else in our history went for nothing but for their steadfast prowess in the greatest crisis of our history all our annals would be meaningless and our great experiment in popular freedom and self government a gloomy failure moreover they not only left us a united nation but they left us also as a heritage the memory of the mighty deeds by which the nation was kept united we are now indeed one nation one in fact as well as in name we are united in our devotion to the flag which is the symbol of national greatness and unity and the very completeness of our union enables us all in every part of the country to glory in the valor shown alike by the sons of the north and the sons of the south in the times that tried men s souls the men who in the last three years have done so well in the east and the west indies and on the mainland of asia have shown that this remembrance is not lost in any serious crisis the united states must rely for the great mass of its fighting men upon the volunteer soldiery who do not make a permanent profession of the military career and whenever such a crisis arises the deathless memories of the civil war will give to americans the lift of lofty purpose which comes to those whose fathers have stood valiantly in the forefront of the battle the merit system of making appointments is in its essence as democratic and american as the common school system itself it simply means that in clerical and other positions where the duties are entirely non political all applicants should have a fair field and no favor each standing on his merits as he is able to show them by practical test written competitive examinations offer the only available means in many cases for applying this system in other cases as where laborers are employed a system of registration undoubtedly can be widely extended there are of course places where the written competitive examination cannot be applied and others where it offers by no means an ideal solution but where under existing political conditions it is though an imperfect means yet the best present means of getting satisfactory results wherever the conditions have permitted the application of the merit system in its fullest and widest sense the gain to the government has been immense the navy yards and postal service illustrate probably better than any other branches of the government the great gain in economy efficiency and honesty due to the enforcement of this principle i recommend the passage of a law which will extend the classified service to the district of columbia or will at least enable the president thus to extend it in my judgment all laws providing for the temporary employment of clerks should hereafter contain a provision that they be selected under the civil service law it is important to have this system obtain at home but it is even more important to have it applied rigidly in our insular possessions not an office should be filled in the philippines or puerto rico with any regard to the man s partisan affiliations or services with any regard to the political social or personal influence which he may have at his command in short heed should be paid to absolutely nothing save the man s own character and capacity and the needs of the service the administration of these islands should be as wholly free from the suspicion of partisan politics as the administration of the army and navy all that we ask from the public servant in the philippines or puerto rico is that he reflect honor on his country by the way in which he makes that country s rule a benefit to the peoples who have come under it this is all that we should ask and we cannot afford to be content with less the merit system is simply one method of securing honest and efficient administration of the government and in the long run the sole justification of any type of government lies in its proving itself both honest and efficient the consular service is now organized under the provisions of a law passed in 1856 which is entirely inadequate to existing conditions the interest shown by so many commercial bodies throughout the country in the reorganization of the service is heartily commended to your attention several bills providing for a new consular service have in recent years been submitted to the congress they are based upon the just principle that appointments to the service should be made only after a practical test of the applicant s fitness that promotions should be governed by trustworthiness adaptability and zeal in the performance of duty and that the tenure of office should be unaffected by partisan considerations the guardianship and fostering of our rapidly expanding foreign commerce the protection of american citizens resorting to foreign countries in lawful pursuit of their affairs and the maintenance of the dignity of the nation abroad combine to make it essential that our consuls should be men of character knowledge and enterprise it is true that the service is now in the main efficient but a standard of excellence cannot be permanently maintained until the principles set forth in the bills heretofore submitted to the congress on this subject are enacted into law in my judgment the time has arrived when we should definitely make up our minds to recognize the indian as an individual and not as a member of a tribe the general allotment act is a mighty pulverizing engine to break up the tribal mass it acts directly upon the family and the individual under its provisions some sixty thousand indians have already become citizens of the united states we should now break up the tribal funds doing for them what allotment does for the tribal lands that is they should be divided into individual holdings there will be a transition period during which the funds will in many cases have to be held in trust this is the case also with the lands a stop should be put upon the indiscriminate permission to indians to lease their allotments the effort should be steadily to make the indian work like any other man on his own ground the marriage laws of the indians should be made the same as those of the whites in the schools the education should be elementary and largely industrial the need of higher education among the indians is very very limited on the reservations care should be taken to try to suit the teaching to the needs of the particular indian there is no use in attempting to induce agriculture in a country suited only for cattle raising where the indian should be made a stock grower the ration system which is merely the corral and the reservation system is highly detrimental to the indians it promotes beggary perpetuates pauperism and stifles industry it is an effectual barrier to progress it must continue to a greater or less degree as long as tribes are herded on reservations and have everything in common the indian should be treated as an individual like the white man during the change of treatment inevitable hardships will occur every effort should be made to minimize these hardships but we should not because of them hesitate to make the change there should be a continuous reduction in the number of agencies in dealing with the aboriginal races few things are more important than to preserve them from the terrible physical and moral degradation resulting from the liquor traffic we are doing all we can to save our own indian tribes from this evil wherever by international agreement this same end can be attained as regards races where we do not possess exclusive control every effort should be made to bring it about i bespeak the most cordial support from the congress and the people for the st louis exposition to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the louisiana purchase this purchase was the greatest instance of expansion in our history it definitely decided that we were to become a great continental republic by far the foremost power in the western hemisphere it is one of three or four great landmarks in our history the great turning points in our development it is eminently fitting that all our people should join with heartiest good will in commemorating it and the citizens of st louis of missouri of all the adjacent region are entitled to every aid in making the celebration a noteworthy event in our annals we earnestly hope that foreign nations will appreciate the deep interest our country takes in this exposition and our view of its importance from every standpoint and that they will participate in securing its success the national government should be represented by a full and complete set of exhibits the people of charleston with great energy and civic spirit are carrying on an exposition which will continue throughout most of the present session of the congress i heartily commend this exposition to the good will of the people it deserves all the encouragement that can be given it the managers of the charleston exposition have requested the cabinet officers to place thereat the government exhibits which have been at buffalo promising to pay the necessary expenses i have taken the responsibility of directing that this be done for i feel that it is due to charleston to help her in her praiseworthy effort in my opinion the management should not be required to pay all these expenses i earnestly recommend that the congress appropriate at once the small sum necessary for this purpose the pan american exposition at buffalo has just closed both from the industrial and the artistic standpoint this exposition has been in a high degree creditable and useful not merely to buffalo but to the united states the terrible tragedy of the president s assassination interfered materially with its being a financial success the exposition was peculiarly in harmony with the trend of our public policy because it represented an effort to bring into closer touch all the peoples of the western hemisphere and give them an increasing sense of unity such an effort was a genuine service to the entire american public the advancement of the highest interests of national science and learning and the custody of objects of art and of the valuable results of scientific expeditions conducted by the united states have been committed to the smithsonian institution in furtherance of its declared purpose for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men the congress has from time to time given it other important functions such trusts have been executed by the institution with notable fidelity there should be no halt in the work of the institution in accordance with the plans which its secretary has presented for the preservation of the vanishing races of great north american animals in the national zoological park the urgent needs of the national museum are recommended to the favorable consideration of the congress perhaps the most characteristic educational movement of the past fifty years is that which has created the modern public library and developed it into broad and active service there are now over five thousand public libraries in the united states the product of this period in addition to accumulating material they are also striving by organization by improvement in method and by co operation to give greater efficiency to the material they hold to make it more widely useful and by avoidance of unnecessary duplication in process to reduce the cost of its administration in these efforts they naturally look for assistance to the federal library which though still the library of congress and so entitled is the one national library of the united states already the largest single collection of books on the western hemisphere and certain to increase more rapidly than any other through purchase exchange and the operation of the copyright law this library has a unique opportunity to render to the libraries of this country to american scholarship service of the highest importance it is housed in a building which is the largest and most magnificent yet erected for library uses resources are now being provided which will develop the collection properly equip it with the apparatus and service necessary to its effective use render its bibliographic work widely available and enable it to become not merely a center of research but the chief factor in great co operative efforts for the diffusion of knowledge and the advancement of learning for the sake of good administration sound economy and the advancement of science the census office as now constituted should be made a permanent government bureau this would insure better cheaper and more satisfactory work in the interest not only of our business but of statistic economic and social science the remarkable growth of the postal service is shown in the fact that its revenues have doubled and its expenditures have nearly doubled within twelve years its progressive development compels constantly increasing outlay but in this period of business energy and prosperity its receipts grow so much faster than its expenses that the annual deficit has been steadily reduced from 11 411 779 in 1897 to 3 923 727 in 1901 among recent postal advances the success of rural free delivery wherever established has been so marked and actual experience has made its benefits so plain that the demand for its extension is general and urgent it is just that the great agricultural population should share in the improvement of the service the number of rural routes now in operation is 6 009 practically all established within three years and there are 6 000 applications awaiting action it is expected that the number in operation at the close of the current fiscal year will reach 8 600 the mail will then be daily carried to the doors of 5 700 000 of our people who have heretofore been dependent upon distant offices and one third of all that portion of the country which is adapted to it will be covered by this kind of service the full measure of postal progress which might be realized has long been hampered and obstructed by the heavy burden imposed on the government through the intrenched and well understood abuses which have grown up in connection with second class mail matter the extent of this burden appears when it is stated that while the second class matter makes nearly three fifths of the weight of all the mail it paid for the last fiscal year only 4 294 445 of the aggregate postal revenue of 111 631 193 if the pound rate of postage which produces the large loss thus entailed and which was fixed by the congress with the purpose of encouraging the dissemination of public information were limited to the legitimate newspapers and periodicals actually contemplated by the law no just exception could be taken that expense would be the recognized and accepted cost of a liberal public policy deliberately adopted for a justifiable end but much of the matter which enjoys the privileged rate is wholly outside of the intent of the law and has secured admission only through an evasion of its require merits or through lax construction the proportion of such wrongly included matter is estimated by postal experts to be one half of the whole volume of second class mail if it be only one third or one quarter the magnitude of the burden is apparent the post office department has now undertaken to remove the abuses so far as is possible by a stricter application of the law and it should be sustained in its effort owing to the rapid growth of our power and our interests on the pacific whatever happens in china must be of the keenest national concern to us the general terms of the settlement of the questions growing out of the antiforeign uprisings in china of 1900 having been formulated in a joint note addressed to china by the representatives of the injured powers in december last were promptly accepted by the chinese government after protracted conferences the plenipotentiaries of the several powers were able to sign a final protocol with the chinese plenipotentiaries on the 7th of last september setting forth the measures taken by china in compliance with the demands of the joint note and expressing their satisfaction therewith it will be laid before the congress with a report of the plenipotentiary on behalf of the united states mr william woodville rockhill to whom high praise is due for the tact good judgment and energy he has displayed in performing an exceptionally difficult and delicate task the agreement reached disposes in a manner satisfactory to the powers of the various grounds of complaint and will contribute materially to better future relations between china and the powers reparation has been made by china for the murder of foreigners during the uprising and punishment has been inflicted on the officials however high in rank recognized as responsible for or having participated in the outbreak official examinations have been forbidden for a period of five years in all cities in which foreigners have been murdered or cruelly treated and edicts have been issued making all officials directly responsible for the future safety of foreigners and for the suppression of violence against them provisions have been made for insuring the future safety of the foreign representatives in peking by setting aside for their exclusive use a quarter of the city which the powers can make defensible and in which they can if necessary maintain permanent military guards by dismantling the military works between the capital and the sea and by allowing the temporary maintenance of foreign military posts along this line an edict has been issued by the emperor of china prohibiting for two years the importation of arms and ammunition into china china has agreed to pay adequate indemnities to the states societies and individuals for the losses sustained by them and for the expenses of the military expeditions sent by the various powers to protect life and restore order under the provisions of the joint note of december 1900 china has agreed to revise the treaties of commerce and navigation and to take such other steps for the purpose of facilitating foreign trade as the foreign powers may decide to be needed the chinese government has agreed to participate financially in the work of bettering the water approaches to shanghai and to tientsin the centers of foreign trade in central and northern china and an international conservancy board in which the chinese government is largely represented has been provided for the improvement of the shanghai river and the control of its navigation in the same line of commercial advantages a revision of the present tariff on imports has been assented to for the purpose of substituting specific for ad valorem duties and an expert has been sent abroad on the part of the united states to assist in this work a list of articles to remain free of duty including flour cereals and rice gold and silver coin and bullion has also been agreed upon in the settlement during these troubles our government has unswervingly advocated moderation and has materially aided in bringing about an adjustment which tends to enhance the welfare of china and to lead to a more beneficial intercourse between the empire and the modern world while in the critical period of revolt and massacre we did our full share in safe guarding life and property restoring order and vindicating the national interest and honor it behooves us to continue in these paths doing what lies in our power to foster feelings of good will and leaving no effort untried to work out the great policy of full and fair intercourse between china and the nations on a footing of equal rights and advantages to all we advocate the open door with all that it implies not merely the procurement of enlarged commercial opportunities on the coasts but access to the interior by the waterways with which china has been so extraordinarily favored only by bringing the people of china into peaceful and friendly community of trade with all the peoples of the earth can the work now auspiciously begun be carried to fruition in the attainment of this purpose we necessarily claim parity of treatment under the conventions throughout the empire for our trade and our citizens with those of all other powers we view with lively interest and keen hopes of beneficial results the proceedings of the pan american congress convoked at the invitation of mexico and now sitting at the mexican capital the delegates of the united states are under the most liberal instructions to cooperate with their colleagues in all matters promising advantage to the great family of american commonwealths as well in their relations among themselves as in their domestic advancement and in their intercourse with the world at large my predecessor communicated to the congress the fact that the weil and la abra awards against mexico have been adjudged by the highest courts of our country to have been obtained through fraud and perjury on the part of the claimants and that in accordance with the acts of the congress the money remaining in the hands of the secretary of state on these awards has been returned to mexico a considerable portion of the money received from mexico on these awards had been paid by this government to the claimants before the decision of the courts was rendered my judgment is that the congress should return to mexico an amount equal to the sums thus already paid to the claimants the death of queen victoria caused the people of the united states deep and heartfelt sorrow to which the government gave full expression when president mckinley died our nation in turn received from every quarter of the british empire expressions of grief and sympathy no less sincere the death of the empress dowager frederick of germany also aroused the genuine sympathy of the american people and this sympathy was cordially reciprocated by germany when the president was assassinated indeed from every quarter of the civilized world we received at the time of the president s death assurances of such grief and regard as to touch the hearts of our people in the midst of our affliction we reverently thank the almighty that we are at peace with the nations of mankind and we firmly intend that our policy shall be such as to continue unbroken these international relations of mutual respect and good will

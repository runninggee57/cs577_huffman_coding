mr speaker mr president members of the house members of the senate my fellow americans all i have i would have given gladly not to be standing here today the greatest leader of our time has been struck down by the foulest deed of our time today john fitzgerald kennedy lives on in the immortal words and works that he left behind he lives on in the mind and memories of mankind he lives on in the hearts of his countrymen no words are sad enough to express our sense of loss no words are strong enough to express our determination to continue the forward thrust of america that he began the dream of conquering the vastness of space the dream of partnership across the atlantic and across the pacific as well the dream of a peace corps in less developed nations the dream of education for all of our children the dream of jobs for all who seek them and need them the dream of care for our elderly the dream of an all out attack on mental illness and above all the dream of equal rights for all americans whatever their race or color these and other american dreams have been vitalized by his drive and by his dedication and now the ideas and the ideals which he so nobly represented must and will be translated into effective action under john kennedy s leadership this nation has demonstrated that it has the courage to seek peace and it has the fortitude to risk war we have proved that we are a good and reliable friend to those who seek peace and freedom we have shown that we can also be a formidable foe to those who reject the path of peace and those who seek to impose upon us or our allies the yoke of tyranny this nation will keep its commitments from south viet nam to west berlin we will be unceasing in the search for peace resourceful in our pursuit of areas of agreement even with those with whom we differ and generous and loyal to those who join with us in common cause in this age when there can be no losers in peace and no victors in war we must recognize the obligation to match national strength with national restraint we must be prepared at one and the same time for both the confrontation of power and the limitation of power we must be ready to defend the national interest and to negotiate the common interest this is the path that we shall continue to pursue those who test our courage will find it strong and those who seek our friendship will find it honorable we will demonstrate anew that the strong can be just in the use of strength and the just can be strong in the defense of justice and let all know we will extend no special privilege and impose no persecution we will carry on the fight against poverty and misery and disease and ignorance in other lands and in our own we will serve all the nation not one section or one sector or one group but all americans these are the united states a united people with a united purpose our american unity does not depend upon unanimity we have differences but now as in the past we can derive from those differences strength not weakness wisdom not despair both as a people and a government we can unite upon a program a program which is wise and just enlightened and constructive for 32 years capitol hill has been my home i have shared many moments of pride with you pride in the ability of the congress of the united states to act to meet any crisis to distill from our differences strong programs of national action an assassin s bullet has thrust upon me the awesome burden of the presidency i am here today to say i need your help i cannot bear this burden alone i need the help of all americans and all america this nation has experienced a profound shock and in this critical moment it is our duty yours and mine as the government of the united states to do away with uncertainty and doubt and delay and to show that we are capable of decisive action that from the brutal loss of our leader we will derive not weakness but strength that we can and will act and act now from this chamber of representative government let all the world know and none misunderstand that i rededicate this government to the unswerving support of the united nations to the honorable and determined execution of our commitments to our allies to the maintenance of military strength second to none to the defense of the strength and the stability of the dollar to the expansion of our foreign trade to the reinforcement of our programs of mutual assistance and cooperation in asia and africa and to our alliance for progress in this hemisphere on the 20th day of january in 1961 john f kennedy told his countrymen that our national work would not be finished in the first thousand days nor in the life of this administration nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet but he said let us begin today in this moment of new resolve i would say to all my fellow americans let us continue this is our challenge not to hesitate not to pause not to turn about and linger over this evil moment but to continue on our course so that we may fulfill the destiny that history has set for us our most immediate tasks are here on this hill first no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor president kennedy s memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long we have talked long enough in this country about equal rights we have talked for one hundred years or more it is time now to write the next chapter and to write it in the books of law i urge you again as i did in 1957 and again in 1960 to enact a civil rights law so that we can move forward to eliminate from this nation every trace of discrimination and oppression that is based upon race or color there could be no greater source of strength to this nation both at home and abroad and second no act of ours could more fittingly continue the work of president kennedy than the early passage of the tax bill for which he fought all this long year this is a bill designed to increase our national income and federal revenues and to provide insurance against recession that bill if passed without delay means more security for those now working more jobs for those now without them and more incentive for our economy in short this is no time for delay it is a time for action strong forward looking action on the pending education bills to help bring the light of learning to every home and hamlet in america strong forward looking action on youth employment opportunities strong forward looking action on the pending foreign aid bill making clear that we are not forfeiting our responsibilities to this hemisphere or to the world nor erasing executive flexibility in the conduct of our foreign affairs and strong prompt and forward looking action on the remaining appropriation bills in this new spirit of action the congress can expect the full cooperation and support of the executive branch and in particular i pledge that the expenditures of your government will be administered with the utmost thrift and frugality i will insist that the government get a dollar s value for a dollar spent the government will set an example of prudence and economy this does not mean that we will not meet out unfilled needs or that we will not honor our commitments we will do both as one who has long served in both houses of the congress i firmly believe in the independence and the integrity of the legislative branch and i promise you that i shall always respect this it is deep in the marrow of my bones with equal firmness i believe in the capacity and i believe in the ability of the congress despite the divisions of opinions which characterize our nation to act to act wisely to act vigorously to act speedily when the need arises the need is here the need is now i ask your help we meet in grief but let us also meet in renewed dedication and renewed vigor let us meet in action in tolerance and in mutual understanding john kennedy s death commands what his life conveyed that america must move forward the time has come for americans of all races and creeds and political beliefs to understand and to respect one another so let us put an end to the teaching and the preaching of hate and evil and violence let us turn away from the fanatics of the far left and the far right from the apostles of bitterness and bigotry from those defiant of law and those who pour venom into our nation s bloodstream i profoundly hope that the tragedy and the torment of these terrible days will bind us together in new fellowship making us one people in our hour of sorrow so let us here highly resolve that john fitzgerald kennedy did not live or die in vain and on this thanksgiving eve as we gather together to ask the lord s blessing and give him our thanks let us unite in those familiar and cherished words america america god shed his grace on thee and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea

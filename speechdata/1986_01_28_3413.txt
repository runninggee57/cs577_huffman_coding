ladies and gentlemen i d planned to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the union but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans today is a day for mourning and remembering nancy and i are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle challenger we know we share this pain with all of the people of our country this is truly a national loss nineteen years ago almost to the day we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground but we ve never lost an astronaut in flight we ve never had a tragedy like this and perhaps we ve forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle but they the challenger seven were aware of the dangers but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly we mourn seven heroes michael smith dick scobee judith resnik ronald mcnair ellison onizuka gregory jarvis and christa mcauliffe we mourn their loss as a nation together for the families of the seven we cannot bear as you do the full impact of this tragedy but we feel the loss and we re thinking about you so very much your loved ones were daring and brave and they had that special grace that special spirit that says give me a challenge and i ll meet it with joy they had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths they wished to serve and they did they served all of us we ve grown used to wonders in this century it s hard to dazzle us but for 25 years the united states space program has been doing just that we ve grown used to the idea of space and perhaps we forget that we ve only just begun we re still pioneers they the members of the challenger crew were pioneers and i want to say something to the schoolchildren of america who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle s takeoff i know it is hard to understand but sometimes painful things like this happen it s all part of the process of exploration and discovery it s all part of taking a chance and expanding man s horizons the future doesn t belong to the fainthearted it belongs to the brave the challenger crew was pulling us into the future and we ll continue to follow them i ve always had great faith in and respect for our space program and what happened today does nothing to diminish it we don t hide our space program we don t keep secrets and cover things up we do it all up front and in public that s the way freedom is and we wouldn t change it for a minute we ll continue our quest in space there will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and yes more volunteers more civilians more teachers in space nothing ends here our hopes and our journeys continue i want to add that i wish i could talk to every man and woman who works for nasa or who worked on this mission and tell them your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades and we know of your anguish we share it there s a coincidence today on this day 390 years ago the great explorer sir francis drake died aboard ship off the coast of panama in his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans and an historian later said he lived by the sea died on it and was buried in it well today we can say of the challenger crew their dedication was like drake s complete the crew of the space shuttle challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives we will never forget them nor the last time we saw them this morning as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of god

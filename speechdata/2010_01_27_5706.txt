madam speaker vice president biden members of congress distinguished guests and fellow americans our constitution declares that from time to time the president shall give to congress information about the state of our union for 220 years our leaders have fulfilled this duty they ve done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility and they ve done so in the midst of war and depression at moments of great strife and great struggle it s tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable that america was always destined to succeed but when the union was turned back at bull run and the allies first landed at omaha beach victory was very much in doubt when the market crashed on black tuesday and civil rights marchers were beaten on bloody sunday the future was anything but certain these were the times that tested the courage of our convictions and the strength of our union and despite all our divisions and disagreements our hesitations and our fears america prevailed because we chose to move forward as one nation as one people again we are tested and again we must answer history s call one year ago i took office amid two wars an economy rocked by a severe recession a financial system on the verge of collapse and a government deeply in debt experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act we might face a second depression so we acted immediately and aggressively and 1 year later the worst of the storm has passed but the devastation remains one in 10 americans still cannot find work many businesses have shuttered home values have declined small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard and for those who d already known poverty life s become that much harder this recession has also compounded the burdens that america s families have been dealing with for decades the burden of working harder and longer for less of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college so i know the anxieties that are out there right now they re not new these struggles are the reason i ran for president these struggles are what i ve witnessed for years in places like elkhart indiana galesburg illinois i hear about them in the letters that i read each night the toughest to read are those written by children asking why they have to move from their home asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work for these americans and so many others change has not come fast enough some are frustrated some are angry they don t understand why it seems like bad behavior on wall street is rewarded but hard work on main street isn t or why washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems they re tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness they know we can t afford it not now so we face big and difficult challenges and what the american people hope what they deserve is for all of us democrats and republicans to work through our differences to overcome the numbing weight of our politics for while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds different stories different beliefs the anxieties they face are the same the aspirations they hold are shared a job that pays the bills a chance to get ahead most of all the ability to give their children a better life and you know what else they share they share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity after one of the most difficult years in our history they remain busy building cars and teaching kids starting businesses and going back to school they re coaching little league and helping their neighbors one woman wrote to me and said we are strained but hopeful struggling but encouraged it s because of this spirit this great decency and great strength that i have never been more hopeful about america s future than i am tonight despite our hardships our union is strong we do not give up we do not quit we do not allow fear or division to break our spirit in this new decade it s time the american people get a government that matches their decency that embodies their strength and tonight i d like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise it begins with our economy our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis it was not easy to do and if there s one thing that has unified democrats and republicans and everybody in between it s that we all hated the bank bailout i hated it i hated it you hated it it was about as popular as a root canal but when i ran for president i promised i wouldn t just do what was popular i would do what was necessary and if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system unemployment might be double what it is today more businesses would certainly have closed more homes would have surely been lost so i supported the last administration s efforts to create the financial rescue program and when we took that program over we made it more transparent and more accountable and as a result the markets are now stabilized and we ve recovered most of the money we spent on the banks most but not all to recover the rest i ve proposed a fee on the biggest banks now i know wall street isn t keen on this idea but if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need now as we stabilized the financial system we also took steps to get our economy growing again save as many jobs as possible and help americans who had become unemployed that s why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million americans made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through cobra and passed 25 different tax cuts now let me repeat we cut taxes we cut taxes for 95 percent of working families we cut taxes for small businesses we cut taxes for first time home buyers we cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children we cut taxes for 8 million americans paying for college i thought i d get some applause on that one as a result millions of americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities all of which helped businesses keep more workers and we haven t raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person not a single dime now because of the steps we took there are about 2 million americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed two hundred thousand work in construction and clean energy three hundred thousand are teachers and other education workers tens of thousands are cops firefighters correctional officers first responders and we re on track to add another 1 million jobs to this total by the end of the year the plan that has made all of this possible from the tax cuts to the jobs is the recovery act that s right the recovery act also known as the stimulus bill economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs and avert disaster but you don t have to take their word for it talk to the small business in phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the recovery act talk to the window manufacturer in philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the recovery act until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that because of the recovery act she wouldn t be laid off after all there are stories like this all across america and after 2 years of recession the economy is growing again retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value businesses are beginning to invest again and slowly some are starting to hire again but i realize that for every success story there are other stories of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response that is why jobs must be our number one focus in 2010 and that s why i m calling for a new jobs bill tonight now the true engine of job creation in this country will always be america s businesses i agree absolutely but government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers we should start where most new jobs do in small businesses companies that begin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream or a worker decides it s time she became her own boss through sheer grit and determination these companies have weathered the recession and they re ready to grow but when you talk to small business owners in places like allentown pennsylvania or elyria ohio you find out that even though banks on wall street are lending again they re mostly lending to bigger companies financing remains difficult for small business owners across the country even those that are making a profit so tonight i m proposing that we take 30 billion of the money wall street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat i m also proposing a new small business tax credit one that will go to over 1 million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages while we re at it let s also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small business investment and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment next we can put americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow from the first railroads to the interstate highway system our nation has always been built to compete there s no reason europe or china should have the fastest trains or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products tomorrow i ll visit tampa florida where workers will soon break ground on a new high speed railroad funded by the recovery act there are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our nation s goods services and information we should put more americans to work building clean energy facilities and give rebates to americans who make their homes more energy efficient which supports clean energy jobs and to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the united states of america now the house has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps as the first order of business this year i urge the senate to do the same and i know they will they will people are out of work they re hurting they need our help and i want a jobs bill on my desk without delay but the truth is these steps won t make up for the 7 million jobs that we ve lost over the last 2 years the only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long term economic growth and finally address the problems that america s families have confronted for years we can t afford another so called economic expansion like the one from the last decade what some call the lost decade where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion where the income of the average american household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation from the day i took office i ve been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious such an effort would be too contentious i ve been told that our political system is too gridlocked and that we should just put things on hold for a while for those who make these claims i have one simple question how long should we wait how long should america put its future on hold you see washington has been telling us to wait for decades even as the problems have grown worse meanwhile china s not waiting to revamp its economy germany s not waiting india s not waiting these nations are they re not standing still these nations aren t playing for second place they re putting more emphasis on math and science they re rebuilding their infrastructure they re making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs well i do not accept second place for the united states of america as hard as it may be as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become it s time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth now one place to start is serious financial reform look i am not interested in punishing banks i m interested in protecting our economy a strong healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs it channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes but that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy we need to make sure consumers and middle class families have the information they need to make financial decisions we can t allow financial institutions including those that take your deposits to take risks that threaten the whole economy now the house has already passed financial reform with many of these changes and the lobbyists are trying to kill it but we cannot let them win this fight and if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform i will send it back until we get it right we ve got to get it right next we need to encourage american innovation last year we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history an investment that could lead to the world s cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched and no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy you can see the results of last year s investments in clean energy in the north carolina company that will create 1 200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries or in the california business that will put a thousand people to work making solar panels but to create more of these clean energy jobs we need more production more efficiency more incentives and that means building a new generation of safe clean nuclear powerplants in this country it means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development it means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies and yes it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in america now i am grateful to the house for passing such a bill last year and this year i m eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the senate i know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy i know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change but here s the thing even if you doubt the evidence providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy and america must be that nation third we need to export more of our goods because the more products we make and sell to other countries the more jobs we support right here in america so tonight we set a new goal we will double our exports over the next 5 years an increase that will support 2 million jobs in america to help meet this goal we re launching a national export initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports and reform export controls consistent with national security we have to seek new markets aggressively just as our competitors are if america sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores but realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules and that s why we ll continue to shape a doha trade agreement that opens global markets and why we will strengthen our trade relations in asia and with key partners like south korea and panama and colombia fourth we need to invest in the skills and education of our people now this year we ve broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools and the idea here is simple instead of rewarding failure we only reward success instead of funding the status quo we only invest in reform reform that raises student achievement inspires students to excel in math and science and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young americans from rural communities to the inner city in the 21st century the best antipoverty program around is a world class education and in this country the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential when we renew the elementary and secondary education act we will work with congress to expand these reforms to all 50 states still in this economy a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job that s why i urge the senate to follow the house and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families to make college more affordable this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans instead let s take that money and give families a 10 000 tax credit for 4 years of college and increase pell grants and let s tell another 1 million students that when they graduate they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service because in the united states of america no one should go broke because they chose to go to college and by the way it s time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs because they too have a responsibility to help solve this problem now the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class that s why last year i asked vice president biden to chair a task force on middle class families that s why we re nearly doubling the child care tax credit and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg that s why we re working to lift the value of a family s single largest investment their home the steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of americans to take out new loans and save an average of 1 500 on mortgage payments this year we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages and it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle class families that we still need health insurance reform yes we do now let s clear a few things up i didn t choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt and by now it should be fairly obvious that i didn t take on health care because it was good politics i took on health care because of the stories i ve heard from americans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage patients who ve been denied coverage families even those with insurance who are just one illness away from financial ruin after nearly a century of trying democratic administrations republican administrations we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many americans the approach we ve taken would protect every american from the worst practices of the insurance industry it would give small businesses and uninsured americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market it would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care and by the way i want to acknowledge our first lady michelle obama who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier thank you honey she gets embarrassed our approach would preserve the right of americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan it would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses and according to the congressional budget office the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for congress our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as 1 trillion over the next two decades still this is a complex issue and the longer it was debated the more skeptical people became i take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the american people and i know that with all the lobbying and horse trading the process left most americans wondering what s in it for me but i also know this problem is not going away by the time i m finished speaking tonight more americans will have lost their health insurance millions will lose it this year our deficit will grow premiums will go up patients will be denied the care they need small business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether i will not walk away from these americans and neither should the people in this chamber so as temperatures cool i want everyone to take another look at the plan we ve proposed there s a reason why many doctors nurses and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo but if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums bring down the deficit cover the uninsured strengthen medicare for seniors and stop insurance company abuses let me know let me know let me know i m eager to see it here s what i ask congress though don t walk away from reform not now not when we are so close let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the american people let s get it done let s get it done now even as health care reform would reduce our deficit it s not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves it s a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve and one that s been subject to a lot of political posturing so let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight at the beginning of the last decade the year 2000 america had a budget surplus of over 200 billion by the time i took office we had a 1 year deficit of over 1 trillion and projected deficits of 8 trillion over the next decade most of this was the result of not paying for two wars two tax cuts and an expensive prescription drug program on top of that the effects of the recession put a 3 trillion hole in our budget all this was before i walked in the door now just stating the facts now if we had taken office in ordinary times i would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit but we took office amid a crisis and our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another 1 trillion to our national debt that too is a fact i m absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do but families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions the federal government should do the same so tonight i m proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last year starting in 2011 we are prepared to freeze government spending for 3 years spending related to our national security medicare medicaid and social security will not be affected but all other discretionary government programs will like any cash strapped family we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don t and if i have to enforce this discipline by veto i will we will continue to go through the budget line by line page by page to eliminate programs that we can t afford and don t work we ve already identified 20 billion in savings for next year to help working families we ll extend our middle class tax cuts but at a time of record deficits we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies for investment fund managers and for those making over 250 000 a year we just can t afford it now even after paying for what we spent on my watch we ll still face the massive deficit we had when i took office more importantly the cost of medicare medicaid and social security will continue to skyrocket that s why i ve called for a bipartisan fiscal commission modeled on a proposal by republican judd gregg and democrat kent conrad this can t be one of those washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solve a problem the commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline now yesterday the senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission so i ll issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward because i refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of americans and when the vote comes tomorrow the senate should restore the pay as you go law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s now i know that some in my own party will argue that we can t address the deficit or freeze government spending when so many are still hurting and i agree which is why this freeze won t take effect until next year when the economy is stronger that s how budgeting works but understand if we don t take meaningful steps to rein in our debt it could damage our markets increase the cost of borrowing and jeopardize our recovery all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes from some on the right i expect we ll hear a different argument that if we just make fewer investments in our people extend tax cuts including those for the wealthier americans eliminate more regulations maintain the status quo on health care our deficits will go away the problem is that s what we did for 8 years that s what helped us into this crisis it s what helped lead to these deficits we can t do it again rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated washington for decades it s time to try something new let s invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt let s meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here let s try common sense a novel concept now to do that we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now we face a deficit of trust deep and corrosive doubts about how washington works that have been growing for years to close that credibility gap we have to take action on both ends of pennsylvania avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists to do our work openly to give our people the government they deserve now that s what i came to washington to do that s why for the first time in history my administration posts on our white house visitors online that s why we ve excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs or seats on federal boards and commissions but we can t stop there it s time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client with my administration or with congress it s time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for federal office with all due deference to separation of powers last week the supreme court reversed a century of law that i believe will open the floodgates for special interests including foreign corporations to spend without limit in our elections i don t think american elections should be bankrolled by america s most powerful interests or worse by foreign entities they should be decided by the american people and i d urge democrats and republicans to pass a bill that helps correct some of these problems i m also calling on congress to continue down the path of earmark reform democrats and republicans democrats and republicans look you ve trimmed some of this spending you ve embraced some meaningful change but restoring the public trust demands more for example some members of congress post some earmark requests online tonight i m calling on congress to publish all earmark requests on a single web site before there s a vote so that the american people can see how their money is being spent of course none of these reforms will even happen if we don t also reform how we work with one another now i m not naive i never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony and some postpartisan era i knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched and on some issues there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways these disagreements about the role of government in our lives about our national priorities and our national security they ve been taking place for over 200 years they re the very essence of our democracy but what frustrates the american people is a washington where every day is election day we can t wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side a belief that if you lose i win neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can the confirmation of i m speaking to both parties now the confirmation of well qualified public servants shouldn t be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual senators washington may think that saying anything about the other side no matter how false no matter how malicious is just part of the game but it s precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the american people worse yet it s sowing further division among our citizens further distrust in our government so no i will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics i know it s an election year and after last week it s clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual but we still need to govern to democrats i would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades and the people expect us to solve problems not run for the hills and if the republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the senate are required to do any business at all in this town a supermajority then the responsibility to govern is now yours as well just saying no to everything may be good short term politics but it s not leadership we were sent here to serve our citizens not our ambitions so let s show the american people that we can do it together this week i ll be addressing a meeting of the house republicans i d like to begin monthly meetings with both democratic and republican leadership i know you can t wait now throughout our history no issue has united this country more than our security sadly some of the unity we felt after 9 11 has dissipated and we can argue all we want about who s to blame for this but i m not interested in relitigating the past i know that all of us love this country all of us are committed to its defense so let s put aside the schoolyard taunts about who s tough let s reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values let s leave behind the fear and division and do what it takes to defend our nation and forge a more hopeful future for america and for the world that s the work we began last year since the day i took office we ve renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our nation we ve made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take american lives we are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed christmas attack with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence we ve prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the pacific to south asia to the arabian peninsula and in the last year hundreds of al qaida s fighters and affiliates including many senior leaders have been captured or killed far more than in 2008 and in afghanistan we re increasing our troops and training afghan security forces so they can begin to take the lead in july of 2011 and our troops can begin to come home we will reward good governance work to reduce corruption and support the rights of all afghans men and women alike we re joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitments and who will come together tomorrow in london to reaffirm our common purpose there will be difficult days ahead but i am absolutely confident we will succeed as we take the fight to al qaida we are responsibly leaving iraq to its people as a candidate i promised that i would end this war and that is what i am doing as president we will have all of our combat troops out of iraq by the end of this august we will support the iraqi government as they hold elections and we will continue to partner with the iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity but make no mistake this war is ending and all of our troops are coming home tonight all of our men and women in uniform in iraq in afghanistan and around the world they have to know that we that they have our respect our gratitude our full support and just as they must have the resources they need in war we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home that s why we made the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades last year that s why we re building a 21st century va and that s why michelle has joined with jill biden to forge a national commitment to support military families now even as we prosecute two wars we re also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the american people the threat of nuclear weapons i ve embraced the vision of john f kennedy and ronald reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them to reduce our stockpiles and launchers while ensuring our deterrent the united states and russia are completing negotiations on the farthest reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades and at april s nuclear security summit we will bring 44 nations together here in washington dc behind a clear goal securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in 4 years so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists now these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons that s why north korea now faces increased isolation and stronger sanctions sanctions that are being vigorously enforced that s why the international community is more united and the islamic republic of iran is more isolated and as iran s leaders continue to ignore their obligations there should be no doubt they too will face growing consequences that is a promise that s the leadership we are providing engagement that advances the common security and prosperity of all people we re working through the g 20 to sustain a lasting global recovery we re working with muslim communities around the world to promote science and education and innovation we have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change we re helping developing countries to feed themselves and continuing the fight against hiv aids and we are launching a new initiative that will give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to bioterrorism or an infectious disease a plan that will counter threats at home and strengthen public health abroad as we have for over 60 years america takes these actions because our destiny is connected to those beyond our shores but we also do it because it is right that s why as we meet here tonight over 10 000 americans are working with many nations to help the people of haiti recover and rebuild that s why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in afghanistan why we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of iran why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in guinea for america must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity always abroad america s greatest source of strength has always been our ideals the same is true at home we find unity in our incredible diversity drawing on the promise enshrined in our constitution the notion that we re all created equal that no matter who you are or what you look like if you abide by the law you should be protected by it if you adhere to our common values you should be treated no different than anyone else we must continually renew this promise my administration has a civil rights division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination we finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate this year i will work with congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are it s the right thing to do we re going to crackdown on violations of equal pay laws so that women get equal pay for an equal day s work and we should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system to secure our borders and enforce our laws and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nation in the end it s our ideals our values that built america values that allowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe values that drive our citizens still every day americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers time and again they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country they take pride in their labor and are generous in spirit these aren t republican values or democratic values that they re living by business values or labor values they re american values unfortunately too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions our corporations our media and yes our government still reflect these same values each of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work that helps our country prosper but each time a ceo rewards himself for failure or a banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain people s doubts grow each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country up we lose faith the more that tv pundits reduce serious debates to silly arguments big issues into sound bites our citizens turn away no wonder there s so much cynicism out there no wonder there s so much disappointment i campaigned on the promise of change change we can believe in the slogan went and right now i know there are many americans who aren t sure if they still believe we can change or that i can deliver it but remember this i never suggested that change would be easy or that i could do it alone democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and complicated and when you try to do big things and make big changes it stirs passions and controversy that s just how it is those of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling hard truths and pointing fingers we can do what s necessary to keep our poll numbers high and get through the next election instead of doing what s best for the next generation but i also know this if people had made that decision 50 years ago or 100 years ago or 200 years ago we wouldn t be here tonight the only reason we are here is because generations of americans were unafraid to do what was hard to do what was needed even when success was uncertain to do what it took to keep the dream of this nation alive for their children and their grandchildren now our administration has had some political setbacks this year and some of them were deserved but i wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year and what keeps me going what keeps me fighting is that despite all these setbacks that spirit of determination and optimism that fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the american people that lives on it lives on in the struggling small business owner who wrote to me of his company none of us he said are willing to consider even slightly that we might fail it lives on in the woman who said that even though she and her neighbors have felt the pain of recession we are strong we are resilient we are american it lives on in the 8 year old boy in louisiana who just sent me his allowance and asked if i would give it to the people of haiti and it lives on in all the americans who ve dropped everything to go someplace they ve never been and pull people they ve never known from the rubble prompting chants of u s a u s a u s a when another life was saved the spirit that has sustained this nation for more than two centuries lives on in you its people we have finished a difficult year we have come through a difficult decade but a new year has come a new decade stretches before us we don t quit i don t quit let s seize this moment to start anew to carry the dream forward and to strengthen our union once more thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america

mr chief justice mr secretary senator kennedy members of the fine delegation from new york ladies and gentlemen at the head table my fellow americans to be honored with this award by this organization is a very proud moment for me i accept it with the gratitude of my heart and with renewed commitment to the cause that it represents the cause of freedom at home and the cause of freedom abroad twenty five years ago to a world that was darkened by war president franklin roosevelt described the four freedoms of mankind freedom of speech and expression freedom of every person to worship god in his own way freedom from want freedom from fear franklin roosevelt knew that these freedoms could not be the province of one people alone he called on all his countrymen to assist those who endured the tyrant s bombs and suffered his opposition and oppression he called for courage and for generosity and for resolution in the face of terror and then he said freedom means the supremacy of human rights everywhere our support goes to those who struggle to gain those rights or keep them wendell willkie franklin roosevelt s opponent in the campaign of 1940 shared his belief that freedom could not be founded only on american shores or only for those whose skin is white freedom is an indivisible word wendell willkie said if we want to enjoy it and fight for it we must be prepared to extend it to everyone whether they are rich or poor whether they agree with us or not no matter what their race or the color of their skin that was republican policy 25 years ago it was democratic policy 25 years ago it is americana policy here tonight then how well have we done in our time in making the four freedoms real for our people and for the other people of the world here in america we accord every man the right to worship as he wills i believe we are more tolerant of sectional and religious and racial differences than we were a quarter of a century ago the majority of our people believe that a qualified man or woman of any race of any religion of any section could hold any office in our land this was not so not very dear at all in 1940 we are committed now however great the trial and tension to protecting the right of free expression and peaceful dissent we have learned to despise the witch hunt the unprincipled harassment of a man s integrity and his right to be different we have gained in tolerance and i am determined to use the high office i hold to protect and to encourage that tolerance i do not mean to say that i will remain altogether silent on the critical issues of our day for just as strongly as i believe in other men s freedom to disagree so do i also believe in the president s freedom to attempt to persuade so let me assure you and my fellow americans tonight that i will do everything in my power to defend both twenty five years ago freedom from want had the ring of urgency for our people the unemployment rate stood at 14 5 percent millions of americans had spent the last decade in the breadlines or on farms where the winds howled away any chance for a decent life tonight there are still millions whose poverty haunts our conscience there are still fathers without jobs and there are still children without hope yet for the vast majority of americans these are times when the hand of plenty has replaced the grip of want and for the first time in almost 9 years tonight the unemployment rate has fallen to 4 percent this liberation from want for which we thank god is a testimony to the enduring vitality of the american competitive system the american free enterprise economy it is a testimony also to an enlightened public policy established by franklin roosevelt and strengthened by every administration since his death that policy has freed americans for more hopeful and more productive lives it has relieved their fears of growing old by social security and by medical care it has inspired them with hope for their children by aid to elementary and higher education it has helped to create economic opportunity by enlightened fiscal policies it has granted to millions born into hopelessness the chance of a new start in life by public works by private incentive by poverty programs for the negro american it has opened the door after centuries of enslavement and discrimination opened the doors to the blessings that america offers to those that are willing and able to earn them thus we address the spirit of franklin roosevelt 25 years after his message to america and the world with confidence and with an unflagging determination we have served his vision of the four freedoms essential to mankind here in america yet we know that he did not speak only for america we know that the four freedoms are not secure in america when they are violently denied elsewhere in the world we know too that it requires more than speeches to resist the international enemies of freedom we know that men respond to deeds when they are deaf to words even the precious word freedom may become empty to those without the means to use it for what does freedom mean when famine chokes the land when new millions crowd upon already strained resources when narrow privilege is entrenched behind law and custom when all conspires to teach men that they cannot change the condition of their lives i do not need to tell you how five administrations have labored to give real meaning to freedom in a world where it is often merely a phrase that conceals oppression and neglect men in this room men throughout america have given their skills and their treasure to that work you have warned our people how insatiable is aggression and how it thrives on human misery you have carried the word that without the sense that they can change the conditions of their lives nothing can avail the oppressed of this earth neither good will nor national sovereignty nor massive grants of aid from their more fortunate brothers you have known too that men who believe they can change their destinies will change their destinies armed with that belief they will be willing yes they will be eager to make the sacrifices that freedom demands they will be anxious to shoulder the responsibilities that are inseparably bound to freedom they will be able to look beyond the four essential freedoms beyond to the freedom to learn to master new skills to acquaint themselves with the lore of man and nature to the freedom to grow to become the best that is within them to become to cast off the yoke of discrimination and disease to the freedom to hope and to build on that hope lives of integrity and well being this is what our struggle in vietnam is all about tonight this is what our struggle for equal rights in this country is all about tonight we seek to create that climate at home and abroad where unlettered men can learn where deprived children can grow where hopeless millions can be inspired to change the terms of their existence for the better that climate cannot be created where terror fills the air children cannot learn and men cannot earn their bread and women cannot heal the sick where the night of violence has blotted out the sun whether in the cities and hamlets of vietnam or in the ghettos of our own cities the struggle is the same that struggle is to end the violence against the human mind and body so that the work of peace may be done and the fruits of freedom may be won we are pitting the resources of the law of education and training of our vision and our compassion against that violence here in america and we shall end it in our time on the other side of the earth we are no less committed to ending violence against men who are struggling tonight to be free and it is about that commitment that i have come here to speak now tonight in vietnam more than 200 000 of your young americans stand there fighting for your freedom tonight our people are determined that these men shall have whatever help they need and that their cause which is our cause shall be sustained but in these last days there have been questions about what we are doing in vietnam and these questions have been answered loudly and clearly for every citizen to see and to hear the strength of america can never be sapped by discussion and we have no better nor stronger tradition than open debate free debate in hours of danger we believe with macaulay that men are never so likely to settle a question rightly as when they discuss it freely we are united in our commitment to free discussion so also we are united in our determination that no foe anywhere should ever mistake our arguments for indecision nor our debates for weakness so what are the questions that are still being asked first some ask if this is a war for unlimited objectives the answer is plain the answer is no our purpose in vietnam is to prevent the success of aggression it is not conquest it is not empire it is not foreign bases it is not domination it is simply put just to prevent the forceful conquest of south vietnam by north vietnam second some people ask if we are caught in a blind escalation of force that is pulling us headlong toward a wider war that no one wants the answer again is a simple no we are using that force and only that force that is necessary to stop this aggression our fighting men are in vietnam because tens of thousands of invaders came south before them our numbers have increased in vietnam because the aggression of others has increased in vietnam the high hopes of the aggressor have been dimmed and the tide of the battle has been turned and our measured use of force will and must be continued but this is prudent firmness under what i believe is careful control there is not and there will not be a mindless escalation third others ask if our fighting men are to be denied the help they need the answer again is and will be a resounding no our great military establishment has moved 200 000 men across 10 000 miles since last spring these men have and will have all they need to fight the aggressor they have already performed miracles in combat and the men behind them have worked miracles of supply building new ports transporting new equipment opening new roads the american forces of freedom are strong tonight in south vietnam and we plan to keep them so as you know they are led there by a brilliant and a resourceful commander gen william c westmoreland he knows the needs of war and he supports the works of peace and when he asks for more americans to help the men that he has his requests will be immediately studied and as i promised the nation last july his needs will be immediately met fourth some ask if our men go alone to vietnam if we alone respect our great commitment in the southeast asia treaty still again the answer is a simple no we have seven allies in seato and we have seen five of them give us vital support each with his own strength and in his own way to the cause of freedom in southeast asia fifth some ask about the risks of a wider war perhaps against the vast land armies of red china and again the answer is no never by any act of ours and not if there is any reason left behind the wild words from peking we have threatened no one and we will not we seek the end of no regime and we will not our purpose is solely to defend against aggression to any armed attack we will reply we have measured the strength and the weakness of others and we think we know our own we observe in ourselves and we applaud in others a careful restraint in action we can live with anger in word as long as it is matched by caution in deed sixth men ask if we rely on guns alone still again the answer is no from our honolulu meeting from the clear pledge which joins us with our allies in saigon there has emerged a common dedication to the peaceful progress of the people of vietnam to schools for their children to care for their health to hope and bounty for their land the vice president returned tonight from his constructive and very highly successful visit to saigon and to other capitals and he tells me that he and ambassador lodge have found a new conviction and purpose in south vietnam for the battle against want and injustice as well as the battle against aggression so the pledge of honolulu will be kept and the pledge of baltimore stands open to help the men of the north when they have the wisdom to be ready we americans must understand how fundamental is the meaning of this second war the war on want i talked on my ranch last fall with secretary freeman secretary of agriculture and in my office last week with secretary gardner secretary of health education and welfare making over and over again the same central point the breeding ground of war is human misery if we are not to fight forever in faraway places in europe or the far pacific or the jungles of africa or the suburbs of santo domingo then we just must learn to get at the roots of violence as a nation we must magnify our struggle against world hunger and illiteracy and disease we must bring hope to men whose lives now end at two score or less because without that hope without progress in this war on want we will be called on again to fight again and again as we are fighting tonight seventh men ask who has a right to rule in south vietnam our answer there is what it has been here for 200 years the people must have this right the south vietnamese people and no one else washington will not impose upon the people of south vietnam a government not of their choice hanoi shall not impose upon the people of south vietnam a government not of their choice so we will insist for ourselves on what we require from hanoi respect for the principle of government by the consent of the governed we stand for self determination for free elections and we will honor their result eighth men ask if we are neglecting any hopeful chance of peace and the answer is no a great servant of peace secretary dean rusk has sent the message of peace on every wire and by every hand to every continent a great pleader for peace here with us tonight ambassador arthur goldberg has worked at home and abroad in this same cause their undiscouraged efforts will continue how much wiser it would have been how much more compassionate towards its own people if hanoi had only come to the bargaining table at the close of the year then the 7 000 communist troops who have died in battle since january 1 and the many thousands who have been wounded in that same period would have lived at peace with their fellow men today as then hanoi has the opportunity to end the increasing toll the war is taking on those under its command ninth some ask how long we must bear this burden to that question in all honesty i can give you no answer tonight during the battle of britain when that nation stood alone in 1940 winston churchill gave no answer to that question when the forces of freedom were driven from the philippines president roosevelt could not and did not name the date that we would return if the aggressor persists in vietnam the struggle may well be long our men in battle know and they accept this hard fact we who are at home can do as much because there is no computer that can tell the hour and the day of peace but we do know that it will come only to the steadfast and never to the weak in heart tenth and finally men ask if it is worth it i think you know that answer it is the answer that americans have given for a quarter of a century wherever american strength has been pledged to prevent aggression the contest in vietnam is confused and hard and many of its forms are new yet our american purpose and policy are unchanged our men in vietnam are there they are there as secretary dillon told you to keep a promise that was made 12 years ago the southeast asia treaty promised as secretary john foster dulles said for the united states that an attack upon the treaty area would occasion a reaction so united and so strong and so well placed that the aggressor would lose more than it could hope to gain but we keep more than a specific treaty promise in vietnam tonight we keep the faith for freedom four presidents have pledged to keep that faith the first was franklin d roosevelt in his state of the union message 25 years ago he said we are committed to the proposition that principles of morality and considerations for our own security will never permit us to acquiesce in a peace dictated by aggressors and sponsored by appeasers we know that enduring peace cannot be bought at the cost of other people s freedom the second was harry s truman in 1947 at a historic turning point in the history of guerrilla warfare and of greece turkey and the united states these were his words then i believe that it must be the policy of the united states to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures i believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way the third was dwight d eisenhower in his first inaugural address he promised this realizing that common sense and common decency alike dictate the futility of appeasement we shall never try to placate an aggressor by the false and wicked bargain of trading honor for security americans indeed all free men remember that in the final choice a soldier s pack is not so heavy a burden as a prisoner s chains and then 5 years ago john f kennedy on the cold bright noon of his first day in office proclaimed let the word go forth from this time and place to friend and foe alike that the torch has been passed to a new generation of americans born in this century tempered by war disciplined by a hard and bitter peace proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed and to which we are committed today at home and around the world let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty this is the american tradition built in free discussion proven on a hundred battlefields rewarded by a progress at home that has no match in history it beckons us forward tonight to the work of peace in vietnam we will build freedom while we fight and we will seek peace every day by every honorable means but we will persevere along the high hard road of freedom we are too old to be foolhardy and we are too young to be tired we are too strong for fear and too determined for retreat each evening when i retire i take up from a bedside table reports from the battlefront and reports from the capitals around the world they tell me how our men have fared that day in the hills and the valleys of vietnam they tell me what hope there seems to be that the message of peace will be heard and that this tragic war may be ended i read of individual acts of heroism of dedicated men and women whose valor matches that of any generation that has ever gone before i read of men risking their lives to save others of men giving their lives to save freedom always among these reports are a few letters from the men out there themselves if there is any doubt among some here at home about our purpose in vietnam i never find it reflected in those letters from vietnam our soldiers our marines our airmen and our sailors know why they are in vietnam they know as five presidents have known how inseparably bound together are america s freedom and the freedom of her friends around the world so tonight let me read you from a letter that i received from an american father a warm friend of mine of many years about his son a young army captain he said i have never known a man at war who showed less bravado in his communications with home when he was not flying missions in his helicopter or working out of the battalion headquarters he and some of his buddies on their own visited the orphanages as individuals and played with the kids he was deeply interested in the vietnamese people particularly the peasants and he told me how sorely they wanted more than anything else to just be left alone in some semblance of freedom to grow their rice and to raise their families this good young american as thousands like him was not on the other side of the world fighting specifically for you or for me mr president he was fighting in perhaps our oldest american tradition taking up for people who are king pushed around the young captain described in this letter is dead tonight but his spirit lives in the 200 000 young americans who stand out there on freedom s frontier in vietnam it lives in their mothers and in their fathers here in america who have proudly watched them leave their homes for their distant struggle so tonight i ask each citizen to join me to join me in the homes and the meeting places our men are fighting to keep free in a prayer for their safety i ask you to join me in a pledge to the cause for which they fight the cause of human freedom to which this great organization is dedicated is ask you for your help for your understanding and for your commitment so that this united people may show forth to all the world that america has not ended the only struggle that is worthy of man s unceasing sacrifice the struggle to be free

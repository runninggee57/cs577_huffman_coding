the president friends and reporters i hope you are the same and children of reporters i am so glad so many of you youngsters are here today i want to prove to you that your fathers are really on the job sometimes i am glad your mothers came too i suspect they are also very pleased to find your fathers working today i thought you children deserved a press conference because i know that you have taken so many telephone calls for your fathers and mothers and located your wandering parents at so many receptions that you have become good cub reporters too someone even suggested you should be accredited to the white house here you are i think that that person ought to remain anonymous at least until he has his hair cut again when the press conference is over i want to ask all the children to come up here and pose with me for a group picture and let s don t have any of the mommas or poppas they are always crowding into pictures anyway now let me get the business done first and then we will have the children here secretary of defense mcnamara will leave washington friday for west germany where he will continue his discussions on matters of mutual defense interest with minister of defense mr von hassel the discussions with minister von hassel will include cooperative research and development existing cooperative logistics programs and a continuation of the united states and the federal republic of germany s military purchase offset program i have asked secretary mcnamara to proceed from bonn to saigon where he expects to receive firsthand reports on the progress of military and civilian operations in south viet nam since his last visit the secretary will be accompanied to saigon by the chief of staff of the army general wheeler and assistant secretaries of defense arthur sylvester and john mcnaughton i have today issued an executive order establishing a maritime advisory committee to assist the government in considering matters of vital importance to the maritime industry committee membership will include the secretary of commerce as chairman an the secretary of labor the administrator of the maritime administration and an equal number of distinguished representatives of labor management and the public because of the impact of the activities of certain other governmental agencies upon maritime policies i have requested the secretaries of state agriculture and navy and the director of the federal mediation and conciliation service to participate in the committee s proceedings the creation of this committee provides a useful forum for a careful and constructive consideration of the national defense trade manpower and labor relations programs of one of our oldest and most important industries i have today sent a letter to senator harry byrd of virginia expressing my appreciation for the work of the committee on reduction of nonessential federal expenditures in keeping the country informed on employment trends senator byrd s reports show a favorable employment trend in recent months the figures for march show that total civilian employment was 15 700 below march a year ago in the government i told senator byrd that we are going to do everything possible to hold down the regular seasonal increases in employment which occur in the spring of the year as outdoor work opens up i am determined to hold federal employment to the minimum required to conduct the public business effectively i have asked the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of the interior who normally employ a good many people at this time of the year to be very careful in the people they put on in the next few months i have met in the last few days with key leaders of business and labor as you know i am pleased with the gains made by both groups not at the expense of each other but as the result of our record month 108 billion expansion of gross national product we have a higher productivity we have lower taxes we have a better record of price stability than any other industrial country and some of the gains side by side are for example business corporate profits after taxes this year are running 9 billion above 1961 31 billion against 22 billion corporate cash flow after tax profits is running 16 billion above 1961 65 billion against 49 billion the rate of return on stockholders equity in manufacturing corporations was 9 2 percent for 1960 it was percent for 1963 11 4 percent for the fourth quarter of 1963 and now for labor the long term unemployment in april was down 11 percent from march civilian employment after seasonal correction is up 750 000 from march and 1 8 million over a year ago 4 4 million from early 1961 and 1 7 million in the past year total labor income is up about 50 billion after taxes in 3 years the wage and salary share in corporate gross product has held up better in the 1961 64 expansion than in any other postwar upswing it is above 72 percent now it dropped to 68 70 percent in the earlier upswings so with profits and wages and jobs all rising strongly without rising prices i asked business to hold the price line or even cut prices and to share productivity gains with consumers i asked labor to hold wage increases within the bounds of the economy s productivity increases if they do this the country can go on to the heights of full employment and full use of our great productive potential to the greater gain i think of all our countrymen i have sent a group of businessmen to europe representing the meat packing and cattle industries to explore what can be done to substantially increase u s exports of beef i will receive a full report from them when they return later in the month the department of defense has taken steps today to purchase an additional 40 million pounds annually of u s beef this will be in addition to the 70 million pounds already announced final data on strikes during 1963 is encouraging and just became available they showed that 1963 established a new postwar low in strike activity the estimated working time lost through strikes last year was the lowest percentage since world war ii 0 13 of 1 percent the 941 000 workers involved in strikes were the fewest since 1942 the 3 364 strikes that began in 1963 was the second lowest total since the war twice as much time was lost because of industrial injuries last year as was lost because of strikes i want to congratulate management and labor publicly today on this very fine record they have made i am announcing the appointment of mrs charlotte moton hubbard as deputy assistant secretary of state for public affairs mrs hubbard whose father dr robert moton succeeded booker t washington as president of tuskegee institute has a distinguished record in education civic affairs and government in my first official foreign policy statement as president of the united states i pledged to the representatives of latin american countries the best efforts of this nation toward the fulfillment of the alliance for progress we are carrying out that pledge i intend to ask the ambassadors of each of our alliance partners to return again to the white house to come here next monday to review some of our work in support of latin american development efforts at that time i will sign several new loan agreements and commitment letters for the most recently developed latin american projects while the efforts of governments are vitally important in the struggle for hemispheric progress the efforts of private persons and private groups can also have great impact assistant secretary mann has given me a very encouraging report on the progress of the partners of the alliance program the program is an effort to encourage private groups in the united states to work together with latin americans in the hemisphere s war against poverty and ignorance and disease during the past 6 months private citizens in a number of states in our country have organized to establish contact with interested latin americans i would like to pay these people and these groups in latin america and the united states a very special tribute today i thank them warmly for their interest and efforts in this most important work i am sending to congress today a request for a supplemental appropriation amounting to roughly 40 million for the chamizal settlement the additional funds will enable the united states to carry out the recently ratified chamizal convention this convention which was approved by the senate in december 1963 settles a long standing boundary dispute between the united states and mexico with these funds we will be able to act quickly in purchasing properties in el paso on a basis which is designed to be fair to our own citizens let me also report three new developments with respect to our relations with panama first special ambassador anderson came to see me this morning he has returned from a very fruitful visit to panama during which he met in a very cordial atmosphere with president chiari special ambassador illueca and with other panamanian officials for the purpose of having a preliminary exchange of views on u s panamanian problems i met with the special ambassadors today both from panama and the united states and i expressed to both of them my sincere hope for a mutually satisfactory outcome of their talks in view of the importance to both countries in view of the importance to the hemisphere in view of the importance to the free world second i have received a report on the work of the special u s economic team to panama which i mentioned about 2 weeks ago the team went to panama on april 27 and held a number of conversations with panamanian economic officials and private sector representatives the talks were most fruitful and constructive and helped to lay the foundation for more detailed discussions later in the spring regarding u s cooperation in panama s effort to improve its economy under the alliance for progress third in an effort to further improve the formulation and execution of u s policy towards panama i have directed our ambassador in panama to chair a committee which includes the governor of the panama canal zone and the commander in chief u s southern command this committee will meet regularly to discuss all aspects of u s panamanian relations and make proposals regarding them and finally i have today accepted lifetime membership in the vanderburgh humane society of evansville ind i will be happy to answer any questions if you have any q mr president considering the background of an election year what are your feelings about holding congress in session should they run on a little bit with the civil rights bill the president i would hope and anticipate the civil rights bill would be disposed of in a reasonably short time we have been debating that bill now for almost 2 months and a good many amendments have been offered and are being considered but i hope they can pass the bill the end of the month or the early part of the next month and then we can get on with our food stamp plan in the senate our poverty bill our appalachia bill and our medical aid bill i hope that we can have the pay bill reported by the committee very shortly in the event those bills are not acted upon and some cynical people think that there may be a deliberate slowdown in the senate for the purpose of voting on the civil rights bill among some people and among others for the purpose of not voting on any bill if there should be that kind of a slowdown i would seriously consider coming back here of course after the republican convention and if necessary coming back after the democratic convention the people s business must come first and i think that the people of this country are entitled to have a vote on these important measures this administration is entitled to have a vote on them and i am going to ask the congress to vote them up or down q then sir you are contemplating an extra session of congress the president i am not anticipating what the congress will do at this moment i hope they will pass all the bills if they don t pass the bills i will seriously consider calling them back until they vote the bills up or down i will cross that bridge when i get to it q mr president how do you assess the alabama primary results what are the implications for the south in the democratic ticket in the south the president i think that the people of alabama decided they wanted to vote for their governor and they expressed their sentiment just as the people of wisconsin and the people of indiana have done in that connection in alabama they voted for him and i see that it has no real consequence beyond the boundaries of alabama q mr president i believe you are going into maryland tomorrow on a goodwill tour of the appalachia area and i wonder if while you are there you will speak a good word for your stand in at the maryland primary election senator dan brewster the president well i am going to maryland tomorrow in connection with the appalachia program i have invited the senators of both parties to go with me to all the states involved i am going to take part in no primaries as i have repeatedly said q mr president sir there have been some letters recently from soldiers in south viet nam that say the way the war is being operated there now that we cannot win this is the basis for a request from congressman ed foreman of texas that the house armed services committee conduct a complete examination and review of the war in south viet nam what do you think of this the president we are constantly examining conditions in viet nam as i stated earlier in the day secretary mcnamara is going back there in the early part of this week secretary rusk was there for the last 2 or 3 weeks mr mcnamara was there a short time ago the people who are responsible for carrying on our operations there are constantly examining it to be sure that it is as efficient and effective as possible i have no doubt but what they will do their job well q mr president premier khrushchev says that there is no agreement between the united states and the soviet union permitting american planes to fly in surveillance flights over cuba officials of your administration say there is such an agreement i wonder sir if you can tell us first whether there is this agreement and second what the provisions of the agreement are the president what officials of this administration say that we have an agreement that there will be no over flights q i believe sir in repeated requests to people at the state department this point of view has come up the president i am not familiar with any such agreement that we have with the russian people q mr president you mentioned earlier governor wallace s showing in the alabama primary i wonder if you will say something about the possibility of his performance in wisconsin and indiana on the national political scene the president well i think they speak very well for themselves he got 24 percent of the vote in wisconsin and a little less than 20 percent of the vote in indiana i wouldn t think that would be less than 20 percent of the total vote polled would be any overwhelming endorsement of a man s record q many of the young people here have dogs now that you have brought the subject up perhaps you would tell them the story of your beagles the president well the story of my beagles is that they are very nice dogs and i enjoy them and i think they enjoy me i would like for the people to enjoy both of us q mr president in the past some presidents have worried about over exposure about being seen too much and too often on tv and in the papers i wonder if you feel that that is a problem of your presidency the president well i strive to please and if you will give me any indication of how you feel about the matter i will try to work it into my plans in the future i had observed some little comments by some of the newspaper people about their desire to have live television and i am trying my best to accommodate them although i don t have it very often i hope all of you are enjoying it today i sometimes think that these press conferences can be conducted just as accurately and perhaps as effectively in the president s office but i try to give you a variety as i told you in the beginning i always want to remain accessible i hope the press will never be critical of me for being overaccessible q mr president also in light of pardon me q mr president governor wallace s victory in alabama involved another thing and that is the possibility that his organization won in such a way that it will deny the bona fide democratic candidates the support in the november election i would ask you this what do you think in terms of the health of a two party system of the maneuver for the so called free electors the president i think that people have a right to vote for any group of electors they want i think that they should have the right to vote for any candidate and any party that they desire without confusion q mr president in line with the question about your activities and your frequent appearances could you tell us when was the last time you had a physical examination and if the doctors have admonished you to slow down at all the president no the only hazing i have received in that respect is from the newspaper people and i think we made a grievous error when i asked them to walk around the block with me the other day the doctors i think as a matter of fact i read a report from some doctor i don t know just which one and i have been examined frequently since i have been in the white house the last 6 months and sometimes at greater lengths than i am being examined here today they tell me that my blood pressure is 125 over 78 and that my heart is normal i don t have any aches and pains i feel fine i get adequate rest and good pay and plenty to eat i don t know anyone that is concerned about my health certainly none of my doctors are concerned about it q mr president sir do you feel that an economic boycott of cuba can be effective without the full cooperation of the british and the french the president yes i think it is being effective to the extent of the cooperation they have given us i regret very much to see any of our allies who do not feel that they could cooperate with us all the way we regret that but nonetheless we are going to continue our policy of economic isolation in the hope that we can prevent the spread of castro s communism throughout the hemisphere we are going to constantly insist that our allies do likewise but we don t have the responsibility for any foreign policy except our own they will in the last analysis make the final decision but we are going to continue to urge them to join us in a policy of economic isolation so that communism will not be channeled out to other nations in this hemisphere q mr president are you hopeful about the outcome of senator fulbright s mission to greece and turkey the president yes senator fulbright had announced some engagements in foreign capitals several weeks ago when i learned that he was going to be abroad anyway i asked him to undertake some discussions that i thought would be in the national interest that is not an unusual thing senator mansfield did that last year on behalf of the late beloved president kennedy and other senators and congressmen frequently do it at the suggestion of the president or the state department i have every reason to believe that senator fulbright will carry on some very useful discussions and have a very good report when he returns q mr president does your mission for senator fulbright indicate any approval of his recent speech that we ought to re think our policies in the foreign policy field especially insofar as panama and cuba are concerned the president i stated my views on senator fulbright s position in my new york speech before the associated press my asking him to carry on these discussions for us did not indicate either approval or disapproval i had already indicated that we were not in agreement in toto with his views on either cuba or panama q mr president you are reported as having said to chancellor erhard of germany that the germans should put themselves into the shoes of the russians to understand better the russian concern i want to ask you sir the president i beg your pardon but i am not understanding what you are saying you will either have to speak louder or q mr president you are reported as having said to chancellor erhard that the germans should put themselves into the shoes of the russians to understand better their position about germany i wonder sir what would you think of the idea to apply this principle more universally to more and more countries in their mutual relations to increase trust and confidence and to decrease tension the president well i had an informal discussion with a german newspaperman in company with a friend in the course of that conversation i expressed to him the determination of the american people to avoid war if at all possible that we wanted to find a road to peace and we would do everything we could in that direction i told him that i thought the best way to do that was to follow the golden rule to do unto others as you would have them do unto you and to try to find ways and means of finding areas of agreement i expressed that as my own view and as the policy of this country i have no differences with chancellor erhard in that regard i said no more to the newspaperman than i had said publicly following our visit with him and than we said in our communique and as i repeat today i think it is very important to the people of the world that the leaders of the countries of the world pursue every possible road to peace and to try to achieve it i have no doubt but what the german people will in their own way and through their own qualified people follow that objective as i say there are no differences between chancellor erhard and myself now and there have not been our visit was a very fruitful one and we are in complete agreement the speech that he delivered a few days ago following this article clearly points that out q mr president the economy has just set a peacetime record for no recessions and the indicators pretty much look good for the future is it your thinking and the thinking of your economists in your administration that recessions may be a thing of the past the president no i think that we have to be constantly concerned with economic conditions as i tried to indicate from my statements to you from time to time while our unemployment has dropped from 5 8 to 5 4 we would like to see it go down below 5 this year as quickly as possible we would like to see many of our young people that are now unemployed put to work under our new program that sargent shriver has suggested to the congress i think we have to be concerned with the utilization of idle plant capacity we have to be concerned with the value of the dollar we never know what next month or next quarter or next year may lead to we think that now we are enjoying a very fine record but we are constantly on the alert for any developments that may indicate otherwise we are prepared to take whatever measures may be necessary to attempt to avoid any decline we would not say for a moment though that recessions are not possible q mr president a short time ago you expressed the hope that other flags would join the united states in south viet nam in helping to contain the war against communism can you say if any progress has been made in that line the president yes progress has been made and further progress i believe will be made following secretary rusk s visit in the next few days to the nato ministers meeting i think that a good many countries are giving serious consideration to making contributions in that area to keep communism from enveloping that part of the world we welcome that help and we expect to receive it q mr president in your war against poverty sir the plans that you have have you given any thought as to how the general public might help on a voluntary basis to combat these pockets of distress in this country and particularly in this prosperous time the president yes i have given a great deal of thought to it i appealed to 139 of the big corporate leaders of this country the other evening to do all they could in the way of additional capital investments to provide additional jobs we have talked to mayors groups we have met with governors groups we have met with private groups we have urged them all to develop local plans i have talked to the mayors of large cities such as pittsburgh new york city and other places in the country i have talked to governors not only from the appalachian states but governors from all over the country we feel now that it is the job of the local community and the regional area and the state to do their local planning and not to be told from washington what they ought to do but to tell us what they want to do and how we can help them thank you mr president

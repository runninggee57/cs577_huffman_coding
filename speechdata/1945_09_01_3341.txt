the thoughts and hopes of all america indeed of all the civilized world are centered tonight on the battleship missouri there on that small piece of american soil anchored in tokyo harbor the japanese have just officially laid down their arms they have signed terms of unconditional surrender four years ago the thoughts and fears of the whole civilized world were centered on another piece of american soil pearl harbor the mighty threat to civilization which began there is now laid at rest it was a long road to tokyo and a bloody one we shall not forget pearl harbor the japanese militarists will not forget the u s s missouri the evil done by the japanese war lords can never be repaired or forgotten but their power to destroy and kill has been taken from them their armies and what is left of their navy are now impotent to all of us there comes first a sense of gratitude to almighty god who sustained us and our allies in the dark days of grave danger who made us to grow from weakness into the strongest fighting force in history and who has now seen us overcome the forces of tyranny that sought to destroy his civilization god grant that in our pride of the hour we may not forget the hard tasks that are still before us that we may approach these with the same courage zeal and patience with which we faced the trials and problems of the past four years our first thoughts of course thoughts of gratefulness and deep obligation go out to those of our loved ones who have been killed or maimed in this terrible war on land and sea and in the air american men and women have given their lives so that this day of ultimate victory might come and assure the survival of a civilized world no victory can make good their loss we think of those whom death in this war has hurt taking from them fathers husbands sons brothers and sisters whom they loved no victory can bring back the faces they longed to see only the knowledge that the victory which these sacrifices have made possible will be wisely used can give them any comfort it is our responsibility ours the living to see to it that this victory shall be a monument worthy of the dead who died to win it we think of all the millions of men and women in our armed forces and merchant marine all over the world who after years of sacrifice and hardship and peril have been spared by providence from harm we think of all the men and women and children who during these years have carried on at home in lonesomeness and anxiety and fear our thoughts go out to the millions of american workers and businessmen to our farmers and miners to all those who have built up this country s fighting strength and who have shipped to our allies the means to resist and overcome the enemy our thoughts go out to our civil servants and to the thousands of americans who at personal sacrifice have come to serve in our government during these trying years to the members of the selective service boards and ration boards to the civilian defense and red cross workers to the men and women in the uso and in the entertainment world to all those who have helped in this cooperative struggle to preserve liberty and decency in the world we think of our departed gallant leader franklin d roosevelt defender of democracy architect of world peace and cooperation and our thoughts go out to our gallant allies in this war to those who resisted the invaders to those who were not strong enough to hold out but who nevertheless kept the fires of resistance alive within the souls of their people to those who stood up against great odds and held the line until the united nations together were able to supply the arms and the men with which to overcome the forces of evil this is a victory of more than arms alone this is a victory of liberty over tyranny from our war plants rolled the tanks and planes which blasted their way to the heart of our enemies from our shipyards sprang the ships which bridged all the oceans of the world for our weapons and supplies from our farms came the food and fiber for our armies and navies and for our allies in all the corners of the earth from our mines and factories came the raw materials and the finished products which gave us the equipment to overcome our enemies but back of it all were the will and spirit and determination of a free people who know what freedom is and who know that it is worth whatever price they had to pay to preserve it it was the spirit of liberty which gave us our armed strength and which made our men invincible in battle we now know that that spirit of liberty the freedom of the individual and the personal dignity of man are the strongest and toughest and most enduring forces in all the world and so on v j day we take renewed faith and pride in our own way of life we have had our day of rejoicing over this victory we have had our day of prayer and devotion now let us set aside v j day as one of renewed consecration to the principles which have made us the strongest nation on earth and which in this war we have striven so mightily to preserve those principles provide the faith the hope and the opportunity which help men to improve themselves and their lot liberty does not make all men perfect nor all society secure but it has provided more solid progress and happiness and decency for more people than any other philosophy of government in history and this day has shown again that it provides the greatest strength and the greatest power which man has ever reached we know that under it we can meet the hard problems of peace which have come upon us a free people with free allies who can develop an atomic bomb can use the same skill and energy and determination to overcome all the difficulties ahead victory always has its burdens and its responsibilities as well as its rejoicing but we face the future and all its dangers with great confidence and great hope america can build for itself a future of employment and security together with the united nations it can build a world of peace rounded on justice fair dealing and tolerance as president of the united states i proclaim sunday september the second 1945 to be v j day the day of formal surrender by japan it is not yet the day for the formal proclamation of the end of the war nor of the cessation of hostilities but it is a day which we americans shall always remember as a day of retribution as we remember that other day the day of infamy from this day we move forward we move toward a new era of security at home with the other united nations we move toward a new and better world of cooperation of peace and international good will and cooperation god s help has brought us to this day of victory with his help we will attain that peace and prosperity for ourselves and all the world in the years ahead

mr president and fellow citizens of new york the facts with which i shall deal this evening are mainly old and familiar nor is there anything new in the general use i shall make of them if there shall be any novelty it will be in the mode of presenting the facts and the inferences and observations following that presentation in his speech last autumn at columbus ohio as reported in the new york times senator douglas said our fathers when they framed the government under which we live understood this question just as well and even better than we do now i fully indorse this and i adopt it as a text for this discourse i so adopt it because it furnishes a precise and an agreed starting point for a discussion between republicans and that wing of the democracy headed by senator douglas it simply leaves the inquiry what was the understanding those fathers had of the question mentioned our fathers when they framed the government under which we live understood this question just as well and even better than we do now i fully indorse this and i adopt it as a text for this discourse i so adopt it because it furnishes a precise and an agreed starting point for a discussion between republicans and that wing of the democracy headed by senator douglas it simply leaves the inquiry what was the understanding those fathers had of the question mentioned what is the frame of government under which we live the answer must be the constitution of the united states that constitution consists of the original framed in 1787 and under which the present government first went into operation and 12 subsequently framed amendments the first 10 of which were framed in 1789 who were our fathers that framed the constitution i suppose the 39 who signed the original instrument may be fairly called our fathers who framed that part of the present government it is almost exactly true to say they framed it and it is altogether true to say they fairly represented the opinion and sentiment of the whole nation at that time their names being familiar to nearly all and accessible to quite all need not now be repeated i take these 39 for the present as being our fathers who framed the government under which we live what is the question which according to the text those fathers understood just as well and even better than we do now upon this senator douglas holds the affirmative and republicans the negative this affirmation and denial form an issue and this issue this question is precisely what the text declares our fathers understood better than we let us now inquire whether the 39 or any of them ever acted upon this question and if they did how they acted upon it how they expressed that better understanding in 1784 three years before the constitution the united states then owning the northwestern territory and no other the congress of the confederation had before them the question of prohibiting slavery in that territory and four of the 39 who afterward framed the constitution were in that congress and voted on that question of these roger sherman thomas mifflin and hugh williamson voted for the prohibition thus showing that in their understanding no line dividing local from federal authority nor anything else properly forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory the other of the four james m henry voted against the prohibition showing that for some cause he thought it improper to vote for it in 1787 still before the constitution but while the convention was in session framing it and while the northwestern territory still was the only territory owned by the united states the same question of prohibiting slavery in the territory again came before the congress of the confederation and two more of the 39 who afterward signed the constitution were in that congress and voted on the question they were william blount and william few and they both voted for the prohibition thus showing that in their understanding no line dividing local from federal authority nor anything else properly forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory this time the prohibition became a law being part of what is now well known as the ordinance of 87 the question of federal control of slavery in the territories seems not to have been directly before the convention which framed the original constitution and hence it is not recorded that the 39 or any of them while engaged on that instrument expressed any opinion of that precise question this shows that in their understanding no line dividing local from federal authority nor anything in the constitution properly forbade congress to prohibit slavery in the federal territory else both their fidelity to correct principle and their oath to support the constitution would have constrained them to oppose the prohibition again george washington another of the 39 was then president of the united states and as such approved and signed the bill thus completing its validity as a law and thus showing that in his understanding no line dividing local from federal authority nor anything in the constitution forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory no great while after the adoption of the original constitution north carolina ceded to the federal government the country now constituting the state of tennessee and a few years later georgia ceded that which now constitutes the states of mississippi and alabama in both deeds of cession it was made a condition by the ceding states that the federal government should not prohibit slavery in the ceded country besides this slavery was then actually in the ceded country under these circumstances congress on taking charge of these countries did not absolutely prohibit slavery within them but they did interfere with it take control of it even there to a certain extent in 1798 congress organized the territory of mississippi in the act of organization they prohibited the bringing of slaves into the territory from any place without the united states by fine and giving freedom to slaves so brought this act passed both branches of congress without yeas and nays in that congress were three of the 39 who framed the original constitution they were john langdon george read and abraham baldwin they all probably voted for it certainly they would have placed their opposition to it upon record if in their understanding any line dividing local from federal authority or anything in the constitution properly forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory in 1803 the federal government purchased the louisiana country our former territorial acquisitions came from certain of our own states but this louisiana country was acquired from a foreign nation in 1804 congress gave a territorial organization to that part of it which now constitutes the state of louisiana new orleans lying within that part was an old and comparatively large city there were other considerable towns and settlements and slavery was extensively and thoroughly intermingled with the people congress did not in the territorial act prohibit slavery but they did interfere with it take control of it in a more marked and extensive way than they did in the case of mississippi the substance of the provision therein made in relation to slaves was this act also was passed without yeas and nays in the congress which passed it there were two of the 39 they were abraham baldwin and jonathan dayton as stated in the case of mississippi it is probable they both voted for it they would not have allowed it to pass without recording their opposition to it if in their understanding it violated either the line properly dividing local from federal authority or any provision of the constitution in 1819 20 came and passed the missouri question many votes were taken by yeas and nays in both branches of congress upon the various phases of the general question two of the 39 rufus king and charles pinckney were members of that congress mr king steadily voted for slavery prohibition and against all compromises while mr pinckney as steadily voted against slavery prohibition and against all compromises by this mr king showed that in his understanding no line dividing local from federal authority nor anything in the constitution was violated by congress prohibiting slavery in federal territory while mr pinckney by his votes showed that in his understanding there was some sufficient reason for opposing such prohibition in that case the cases i have mentioned are the only acts of the 39 or of any of them upon the direct issue which i have been able to discover to enumerate the persons who thus acted as being four in 1784 two in 1787 17 in 1789 three in 1798 two in 1804 and two in 1819 20 there would be 30 of them but this would be counting john langdon roger sherman william few rufus king and george read each twice and abraham baldwin three times the true number of those of the 39 whom i have shown to have acted upon the question which by the text they understood better than we is 23 leaving 16 not shown to have acted upon it in any way here then we have 23 out of our 39 fathers who framed the government under which we live who have upon their official responsibility and their corporal oaths acted upon the very question which the text affirms they understood just as well and even better than we do now and 21 of them a clear majority of the whole 39 so acting upon it as to make them guilty of gross political impropriety and wilful perjury if in their understanding any proper division between local and federal authority or anything in the constitution they had made themselves and sworn to support forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories thus the 21 acted and as actions speak louder than words so actions under such responsibility speak still louder two of the 23 voted against congressional prohibition of slavery in the federal territories in the instances in which they acted upon the question but for what reasons they so voted is not known they may have done so because they thought a proper division of local from federal authority or some provision or principle of the constitution stood in the way or they may without any such question have voted against the prohibition on what appeared to them to be sufficient grounds of expediency no one who has sworn to support the constitution can conscientiously vote for what he understands to be an unconstitutional measure however expedient he may think it but one may and ought to vote against a measure which he deems constitutional if at the same time he deems it inexpedient it therefore would be unsafe to set down even the two who voted against the prohibition as having done so because in their understanding any proper division of local from federal authority or anything in the constitution forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in federal territory the remaining 16 of the 39 so far as i have discovered have left no record of their understanding upon the direct question of federal control of slavery in the federal territories but there is much reason to believe that their understanding upon that question would not have appeared different from that of their 23 compeers had it been manifested at all for the purpose of adhering rigidly to the text i have purposely omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any person however distinguished other than the 39 fathers who framed the original constitution and for the same reason i have also omitted whatever understanding may have been manifested by any of the 39 even on any other phase of the general question of slavery if we should look into their acts and declarations on those other phases as the foreign slave trade and the morality and policy of slavery generally it would appear to us that on the direct question of federal control of slavery in federal territories the 16 if they had acted at all would probably have acted just as the 23 did among that 16 were several of the most noted anti slavery men of those times as dr franklin alexander hamilton and gouverneur morris while there was not one now known to have been otherwise unless it may be john rutledge of south carolina the sum of the whole is that of our 39 fathers who framed the original constitution 21 a clear majority of the whole certainly understood that no proper division of local from federal authority nor any part of the constitution forbade the federal government to control slavery in the federal territories while all the rest probably had the same understanding such unquestionably was the understanding of our fathers who framed the original constitution and the text affirms that they understood the question better than we but so far i have been considering the understanding of the question manifested by the framers of the original constitution in and by the original instrument a mode was provided for amending it and as i have already stated the present frame of the government under which we live consists of that original and 12 amendatory articles framed and adopted since those who now insist that federal control of slavery in federal territories violates the constitution point us to the provisions which they suppose it thus violates and as i understand they all fix upon provisions in these amendatory articles and not in the original instrument the supreme court in the dred scott case plant themselves upon the fifth amendment which provides that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law while senator douglas and his peculiar adherents plant themselves upon the tenth amendment providing that the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution are reserved to the states respectively or to the people now it so happens that these amendments were framed by the first congress which sat under the constitution the identical congress which passed the act already mentioned enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory not only was it the same congress but they were the identical same individual men who at the same session and at the same time within the session had under consideration and in progress toward maturity these constitutional amendments and this act prohibiting slavery in all the territory the nation then owned the constitutional amendments were introduced before and passed after the act enforcing the ordinance of 87 so that during the whole pendency of the act to enforce the ordinance the constitutional amendments were also pending the 76 members of that congress including 16 of the framers of the original constitution as before stated were preeminently our fathers who framed that part of the government under which we live which is now claimed as forbidding the federal government to control slavery in the federal territories is it not a little presumptuous in any one at this day to affirm that the two things which that congress deliberately framed and carried to maturity at the same time are absolutely inconsistent with each other and does not such affirmation become impudently absurd when coupled with the other affirmation from the same mouth that those who did the two things alleged to be inconsistent understood whether they really were inconsistent better than we better than he who affirms that they are inconsistent it is surely safe to assume that the 39 framers of the original constitution and the 76 members of the congress which framed the amendments thereto taken together do certainly include those who may be fairly called our fathers who framed the government under which we live and so assuming i defy any man to show that any one of them ever in his whole life declared that in his understanding any proper division of local from federal authority or any part of the constitution forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories i go a step further i defy any one to show that any living man in the whole world ever did prior to the beginning of the present century and i might almost say prior to the beginning of the last half of the present century declare that in his understanding any proper division of local from federal authority or any part of the constitution forbade the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories to those who now so declare i give not only our fathers who framed the government under which we live but with them all other living men within the century in which it was framed among whom to search and they shall not be able to find the evidence of a single man agreeing with them now and here let me guard a little against being misunderstood i do not mean to say we are bound to follow implicitly in whatever our fathers did to do so would be to discard all the lights of current experience to reject all progress all improvement what i do say is that if we would supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any case we should do so upon evidence so conclusive and argument so clear that even their great authority fairly considered and weighed cannot stand and most surely not in a case whereof we ourselves declare they understood the question better than we if any man at this day sincerely believes that a proper division of local from federal authority or any part of the constitution forbids the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories he is right to say so and to enforce his position by all truthful evidence and fair argument which he can but he has no right to mislead others who have less access to history and less leisure to study it into the false belief that our fathers who framed the government under which we live were of the same opinion thus substituting falsehood and deception for truthful evidence and fair argument if any man at this day sincerely believes our fathers who framed the government under which we live used and applied principles in other cases which ought to have led them to understand that a proper division of local from federal authority or some part of the constitution forbids the federal government to control as to slavery in the federal territories he is right to say so but he should at the same time brave the responsibility of declaring that in his opinion he understands their principles better than they did themselves and especially should he not shirk that responsibility by asserting that they understood the question just as well and even better than we do now and now if they would listen as i suppose they will not i would address a few words to the southern people i would say to them you consider yourselves a reasonable and a just people and i consider that in the general qualities of reason and justice you are not inferior to any other people still when you speak of us republicans you do so only to denounce us as reptiles or at the best as no better than outlaws you will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers but nothing like it to black republicans in all your contentions with one another each of you deems an unconditional condemnation of black republicanism as the first thing to be attended to indeed such condemnation of us seems to be an indispensable prerequisite license so to speak among you to be admitted or permitted to speak at all now can you or not be prevailed upon to pause and to consider whether this is quite just to us or even to yourselves bring forward your charges and specifications and then be patient long enough to hear us deny or justify you say we are sectional we deny it that makes an issue and the burden of proof is upon you you produce your proof and what is it why that our party has no existence in your section gets no votes in your section the fact is substantially true but does it prove the issue if it does then in case we should without change of principle begin to get votes in your section we should thereby cease to be sectional you cannot escape this conclusion and yet are you willing to abide by it if you are you will probably soon find that we have ceased to be sectional for we shall get votes in your section this very year you will then begin to discover as the truth plainly is that your proof does not touch the issue the fact that we get no votes in your section is a fact of your making and not of ours and if there be fault in that fact that fault is primarily yours and remains so until you show that we repel you by some wrong principle or practice if we do repel you by any wrong principle or practice the fault is ours but this brings you to where you ought to have started to a discussion of the right or wrong of our principle if our principle put in practice would wrong your section for the benefit of ours or for any other object then our principle and we with it are sectional and are justly opposed and denounced as such meet us then on the question of whether our principle put in practice would wrong your section and so meet us as if it were possible that something may be said on our side do you accept the challenge no then you really believe that the principle which our fathers who framed the government under which we live thought so clearly right as to adopt it and indorse it again and again upon their official oaths is in fact so clearly wrong as to demand your condemnation without a moment s consideration some of you delight to flaunt in our faces the warning against sectional parties given by washington in his farewell address less than eight years before washington gave that warning he had as president of the united states approved and signed an act of congress enforcing the prohibition of slavery in the northwestern territory which act embodied the policy of the government upon that subject up to and at the very moment he penned that warning and about one year after he penned it he wrote la fayette that he considered that prohibition a wise measure expressing in the same connection his hope that we should at some time have a confederacy of free states bearing this in mind and seeing that sectionalism has since arisen upon this same subject is that warning a weapon in your hands against us or in our hands against you could washington himself speak would he cast the blame of that sectionalism upon us who sustain his policy or upon you who repudiate it we respect that warning of washington and we commend it to you together with his example pointing to the right application of it but you say you are conservative eminently conservative while we are revolutionary destructive or something of the sort what is conservatism is it not adherence to the old and tried against the new and untried we stick to contend for the identical old policy on the point in controversy which was adopted by our fathers who framed the government under which we live while you with one accord reject and scout and spit upon that old policy and insist upon substituting something new true you disagree among yourselves as to what that substitute shall be you are divided on new propositions and plans but you are unanimous in rejecting and denouncing the old policy of the fathers some of you are for reviving the foreign slave trade some for a congressional slave code for the territories some for congress forbidding the territories to prohibit slavery within their limits some for maintaining slavery in the territories through the judiciary some for the gur reat pur rinciple that if one man would enslave another no third man should object fantastically called popular sovereignty but never a man among you in favor of federal prohibition of slavery in federal territories according to the practice of our fathers who framed the government under which we live not one of all your various plans can show a precedent or an advocate in the century within which our government originated consider then whether your claim of conservatism for yourselves and your charge of destructiveness against us are based on the most clear and stable foundations again you say we have made the slavery question more prominent than it formerly was we deny it we admit that it is more prominent but we deny that we made it so it was not we but you who discarded the old policy of the fathers we resisted and still resist your innovation and thence comes the greater prominence of the question would you have that question reduced to its former proportions go back to that old policy what has been will be again under the same conditions if you would have the peace of the old times readopt the precepts and policy of the old times you charge that we stir up insurrections among your slaves we deny it and what is your proof harper s ferry john brown john brown was no republican and you have failed to implicate a single republican in his harper s ferry enterprise if any member of our party is guilty in that matter you know it or you do not know it if you do know it you are inexcusable for not designating the man and proving the fact if you do not know it you are inexcusable for asserting it and especially for persisting in the assertion after you have tried and failed to make the proof you need not be told that persisting in a charge which one does not know to be true is simply malicious slander some of you admit that no republican designedly aided or encouraged the harper s ferry affair but still insist that our doctrines and declarations necessarily lead to such results we do not believe it we know we hold to no doctrine and make no declaration which were not held to and made by our fathers who framed the government under which we live you never dealt fairly by us in relation to this affair when it occurred some important state elections were near at hand and you were in evident glee with the belief that by charging the blame upon us you could get an advantage of us in those elections the elections came and your expectations were not quite fulfilled every republican man knew that as to himself at least your charge was a slander and he was not much inclined by it to cast his vote in your favor republican doctrines and declarations are accompanied with a continual protest against any interference whatever with your slaves or with you about your slaves surely this does not encourage them to revolt true we do in common with our fathers who framed the government under which we live declare our belief that slavery is wrong but the slaves do not hear us declare even this for anything we say or do the slaves would scarcely know there is a republican party i believe they would not in fact generally know it but for your misrepresentations of us in their hearing in your political contests among yourselves each faction charges the other with sympathy with black republicanism and then to give point to the charge defines black republicanism to simply be insurrection blood and thunder among the slaves mr jefferson did not mean to say nor do i that the power of emancipation is in the federal government he spoke of virginia and as to the power of emancipation i speak of the slaveholding states only the federal government however as we insist has the power of restraining the extension of the institution the power to insure that a slave insurrection shall never occur on any american soil which is now free from slavery john brown s effort was peculiar it was not a slave insurrection it was an attempt by white men to get up a revolt among slaves in which the slaves refused to participate in fact it was so absurd that the slaves with all their ignorance saw plainly enough it could not succeed that affair in its philosophy corresponds with the many attempts related in history at the assassination of kings and emperors an enthusiast broods over the oppression of a people till he fancies himself commissioned by heaven to liberate them he ventures the attempt which ends in little else than his own execution orsini s attempt on louis napoleon and john brown s attempt at harper s ferry were in their philosophy precisely the same the eagerness to cast blame on old england in the one case and on new england in the other does not disprove the sameness of the two things and how much would it avail you if you could by the use of john brown helper s book and the like break up the republican organization human action can be modified to some extent but human nature cannot be changed there is a judgment and a feeling against slavery in this nation which cast at least a million and a half of votes you cannot destroy that judgment and feeling that sentiment by breaking up the political organization which rallies around it you can scarcely scatter and disperse an army which has been formed into order in the face of your heaviest fire but if you could how much would you gain by forcing the sentiment which created it out of the peaceful channel of the ballot box into some other channel what would that other channel probably be would the number of john browns be lessened or enlarged by the operation but you will break up the union rather than submit to a denial of your constitutional rights that has a somewhat reckless sound but it would be palliated if not fully justified were we proposing by the mere force of numbers to deprive you of some right plainly written down in the constitution but we are proposing no such thing when you make these declarations you have a specific and well understood allusion to an assumed constitutional right of yours to take slaves into the federal territories and to hold them there as property but no such right is specifically written in the constitution that instrument is literally silent about any such right we on the contrary deny that such a right has any existence in the constitution even by implication your purpose then plainly stated is that you will destroy the government unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the constitution as you please on all points in dispute between you and us you will rule or ruin in all events this plainly stated is your language perhaps you will say the supreme court has decided the disputed constitutional question in your favor not quite so but waiving the lawyer s distinction between dictum and decision the court have decided the question for you in a sort of way the court have substantially said it is your constitutional right to take slaves into the federal territories and to hold them there as property when i say the decision was made in a sort of way i mean it was made in a divided court by a bare majority of the judges and they not quite agreeing with one another in the reasons for making it that it is so made as that its avowed supporters disagree with one another about its meaning and that it was mainly based upon a mistaken statement of fact the statement in the opinion that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution to show all this is easy and certain when this obvious mistake of the judges shall be brought to their notice is it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the mistaken statement and reconsider the conclusion based upon it and then it is to be remembered that our fathers who framed the government under which we live the men who made the constitution decided this same constitutional question in our favor long ago decided it without division among themselves when making the decision without division among themselves about the meaning of it after it was made and so far as any evidence is left without basing it upon any mistaken statement of facts under all these circumstances do you really feel yourselves justified to break up this government unless such a court decision as yours is shall be at once submitted to as a conclusive and final rule of political action but you will not abide the election of a republican president in that supposed event you say you will destroy the union and then you say the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us that is cool a highwayman holds a pistol to my ear and mutters through his teeth stand and deliver or i shall kill you and then you will be a murderer to be sure what the robber demanded of me my money was my own and i had a clear right to keep it but it was no more my own than my vote is my own and the threat of death to me to extort my money and the threat of destruction to the union to extort my vote can scarcely be distinguished in principle will they be satisfied if the territories be unconditionally surrendered to them we know they will not in all their present complaints against us the territories are scarcely mentioned invasions and insurrections are the rage now will it satisfy them if in the future we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections we know it will not we so know because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and insurrections and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the charge and the denunciation the question recurs what will satisfy them simply this we must not only let them alone but we must somehow convince them that we do let them alone this we know by experience is no easy task we have been so trying to convince them from the very beginning of our organization but with no success in all our platforms and speeches we have constantly protested our purpose to let them alone but this has had no tendency to convince them alike unavailing to convince them is the fact that they have never detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them wrong as we think slavery is we can yet afford to let it alone where it is because that much is due to the necessity arising from its actual presence in the nation but can we while our votes will prevent it allow it to spread into the national territories and to overrun us here in these free states if our sense of duty forbids this then let us stand by our duty fearlessly and effectively let us be diverted by none of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and belabored contrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong vain as the search for a man who should be neither a living man nor a dead man such as a policy of don t care on a question about which all true men do care such as union appeals beseeching true union men to yield to disunionists reversing the divine rule and calling not the sinners but the righteous to repentance such as invocations to washington imploring men to unsay what washington said and undo what washington did neither let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us nor frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the government nor of dungeons to ourselves let us have faith that right makes might and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it

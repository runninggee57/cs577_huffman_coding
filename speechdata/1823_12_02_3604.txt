fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives many important subjects will claim your attention during the present session of which i shall endeavor to give in aid of your deliberations a just idea in this communication i undertake this duty with diffidence from the vast extent of the interests on which i have to treat and of their great importance to every portion of our union i enter on it with zeal from a thorough conviction that there never was a period since the establishment of our revolution when regarding the condition of the civilized world and its bearing on us there was greater necessity for devotion in the public servants to their respective duties or for virtue patriotism and union in our constituents meeting in you a new congress i deem it proper to present this view of public affairs in greater detail than might otherwise be necessary i do it however with peculiar satisfaction from a knowledge that in this respect i shall comply more fully with the sound principles of our government the people being with us exclusively the sovereign it is indispensable that full information be laid before them on all important subjects to enable them to exercise that high power with complete effect if kept in the dark they must be incompetent to it we are all liable to error and those who are engaged in the management of public affairs are more subject to excitement and to be led astray by their particular interests and passions than the great body of our constituents who living at home in the pursuit of their ordinary avocations are calm but deeply interested spectators of events and of the conduct of those who are parties to them to the people every department of the government and every individual in each are responsible and the more full their information the better they can judge of the wisdom of the policy pursued and of the conduct of each in regard to it from their dispassionate judgment much aid may always be obtained while their approbation will form the greatest incentive and most gratifying reward for virtuous actions and the dread of their censure the best security against the abuse of their confidence their interests in all vital questions are the same and the bond by sentiment as well as by interest will be proportionably strengthened as they are better informed of the real state of public affairs especially in difficult conjunctures it is by such knowledge that local prejudices and jealousies are surmounted and that a national policy extending its fostering care and protection to all the great interests of our union is formed and steadily adhered to a precise knowledge of our relations with foreign powers as respects our negotiations and transactions with each is thought to be particularly necessary equally necessary is it that we should for a just estimate of our resources revenue and progress in every kind of improvement connected with the national prosperity and public defense it is by rendering justice to other nations that we may expect it from them it is by our ability to resent injuries and redress wrongs that we may avoid them the commissioners under the 5th article of the treaty of ghent having disagreed in their opinions respecting that portion of the boundary between the territories of the united states and of great britain the establishment of which had been submitted to them have made their respective reports in compliance with that article that the same might be referred to the decision of a friendly power it being manifest however that it would be difficult if not impossible for any power to perform that office without great delay and much inconvenience to itself a proposal has been made by this government and acceded to by that of great britain to endeavor to establish that boundary by amicable negotiation it appearing from long experience that no satisfactory arrangement could be formed of the commercial intercourse between the united states and the british colonies in this hemisphere by legislative acts while each party pursued its own course without agreement or concert with the other a proposal has been made to the british government to regulate this commerce by treaty as it has been to arrange in like manner the just claim of the citizens of the united states inhabiting the states and territories bordering on the lakes and rivers which empty into the st lawrence to the navigation of that river to the ocean for these and other objects of high importance to the interests of both parties a negotiation has been opened with the british government which it is hoped will have a satisfactory result the commissioners under the 6th and 7th articles of the treaty of ghent having successfully closed their labors in relation to the 6th have proceeded to the discharge of those relating to the 7th their progress in the extensive survey required for the performance of their duties justifies the presumption that it will be completed in the ensuing year the negotiation which had been long depending with the french government on several important subjects and particularly for a just indemnity for losses sustained in the late wars by the citizens of the united states under unjustifiable seizures and confiscations of their property has not as yet had the desired effect as this claim rests on the same principle with others which have been admitted by the french government it is not perceived on what just ground it can be rejected a minister will be immediately appointed to proceed to france and resume the negotiation on this and other subjects which may arise between the two nations at the proposal of the russian imperial government made through the minister of the emperor residing here a full power and instructions have been transmitted to the minister of the united states at st petersburg to arrange by amicable negotiation the respective rights and interests of the two nations on the north west coast of this continent a similar proposal had been made by his imperial majesty to the government of great britain which has likewise been acceded to the government of the united states has been desirous by this friendly proceeding of manifesting the great value which they have invariably attached to the friendship of the emperor and their solicitude to cultivate the best understanding with his government in the discussions to which this interest has given rise and in the arrangements by which they may terminate the occasion has been judged proper for asserting as a principle in which the rights and interests of the united states are involved that the american continents by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any european powers since the close of the last session of congress the commissioners and arbitrators for ascertaining and determining the amount of indemnification which may be due to citizens of the united states under the decision of his imperial majesty the emperor of russia in conformity to the convention concluded at st petersburg on 1822 07 12 have assembled in this city and organized themselves as a board for the performance of the duties assigned to them by that treaty the commission constituted under the 11th article of the treaty of 1819 02 22 between the united states and spain is also in session here and as the term of three years limited by the treaty for the execution of the trust will expire before the period of the next regular meeting of congress the attention of the legislature will be drawn to the measures which may be necessary to accomplish the objects for which the commission was instituted in compliance with a resolution of the house of representatives adopted at their last session instructions have been given to all the ministers of the united states accredited to the powers of europe and america to propose the proscription of the african slave trade by classing it under the denomination and inflicting on its perpetrators the punishment of piracy should this proposal be acceded to it is not doubted that this odious and criminal practice will be promptly and entirely suppressed it is earnestly hoped that it will be acceded to from the firm belief that it is the most effectual expedient that can be adopted for the purpose at the commencement of the recent war between france and spain it was declared by the french government that it would grant no commissions to privateers and that neither the commerce of spain herself nor of neutral nations should be molested by the naval force of france except in the breach of a lawful blockade this declaration which appears to have been faithfully carried into effect concurring with principles proclaimed and cherished by the united states from the first establishment of their independence suggested the hope that the time had arrived when the proposal for adopting it as a permanent and invariable rule in all future maritime wars might meet the favorable consideration of the great european powers instructions have accordingly been given to our ministers with france russia and great britain to make those proposals to their respective governments and when the friends of humanity reflect on the essential amelioration to the condition of the human race which would result from the abolition of private war on the sea and on the great facility by which it might be accomplished requiring only the consent of a few sovereigns an earnest hope is indulged that these overtures will meet with an attention animated by the spirit in which they were made and that they will ultimately be successful the ministers who were appointed to the republics of colombia and buenos ayres during the last session of congress proceeded shortly afterwards to their destinations of their arrival there official intelligence has not yet been received the minister appointed to the republic of chile will sail in a few days an early appointment will also be made to mexico a minister has been received from colombia and the other governments have been informed that ministers or diplomatic agents of inferior grade would be received from each accordingly as they might prefer the one or the other the minister appointed to spain proceeded soon after his appointment for cadiz the residence of the sovereign to whom he was accredited in approaching that port the frigate which conveyed him was warned off by the commander of the french squadron by which it was blockaded and not permitted to enter although apprised by the captain of the frigate of the public character of the person whom he had on board the landing of whom was the sole object of his proposed entry this act being considered an infringement of the rights of ambassadors and of nations will form a just cause of complaint to the government of france against the officer by whom it was committed the actual condition of the public finances more than realizes the favorable anticipations that were entertained of it at the opening of the last session of congress on the first of january there was a balance in the treasury of 4 237 427 55 from that time to the 30th of september the receipts amounted to upward of 16 1m and the expenditures to 11 4m during the 4th quarter of the year it is estimated that the receipts will at least equal the expenditures and that there will remain in the treasury on the first day of january next a surplus of nearly 9m on 1825 01 01 a large amount of the war debt and a part of the revolutionary debt become redeemable additional portions of the former will continue to become redeemable annually until the year 1835 it is believed however that if the united states remain at peace the whole of that debt may be redeemed by the ordinary revenue of those years during that period under the provision of the act of 1817 03 03 creating the sinking fund and in that case the only part of the debt that will remain after the year 1835 will be the 7m of 5 stock subscribed to the bank of the united states and the 3 revolutionary debt amounting to 13 296 099 06 both of which are redeemable at the pleasure of the government the state of the army in its organization and discipline has been gradually improving for several years and has now attained a high degree of perfection the military disbursements have been regularly made and the accounts regularly and promptly rendered for settlement the supplies of various descriptions have been of good quality and regularly issued at all of the posts a system of economy and accountability has been introduced into every branch of the service which admits of little additional improvement this desirable state has been attained by the act reorganizing the staff of the army passed on 1818 04 14 the moneys appropriated for fortifications have been regularly and economically applied and all the works advanced as rapidly as the amount appropriated would admit three important works will be completed in the course of this year that is fort washington fort delaware and the fort at the rigolets in louisiana the board of engineers and the topographical corps have been in constant and active service in surveying the coast and projecting the works necessary for its defense the military academy has attained a degree of perfection in its discipline and instruction equal as is believed to any institution of its kind in any country the money appropriated for the use of the ordnance department has been regularly and economically applied the fabrication of arms at the national armories and by contract with the department has been gradually improving in quality and cheapness it is believed that their quality is now such as to admit of but little improvement the completion of the fortifications renders it necessary that there should be a suitable appropriation for the purpose of fabricating the cannon and carriages necessary for those works under the appropriation of 5 000 for exploring the western waters for the location of a site for a western armory a commission was constituted consisting of colonel mcree colonel lee and captain talcott who have been engaged in exploring the country they have not yet reported the result of their labors but it is believed that they will be prepared to do it at an early part of the session of congress during the month of june last general ashley and his party who were trading under a license from the government were attacked by the ricarees while peaceably trading with the indians at their request several of the party were killed and wounded and their property taken or destroyed colonel leavenworth who commanded fort atkinson at the council bluffs the most western post apprehending that the hostile spirit of the ricarees would extend to other tribes in that quarter and that thereby the lives of the traders on the missouri and the peace of the frontier would be endangered took immediate measures to check the evil with a detachment of the regiment stationed at the bluffs he successfully attacked the ricaree village and it is hoped that such an impression has been made on them as well as on the other tribes on the missouri as will prevent a recurrence of future hostility the report of the secretary of war which is herewith transmitted will exhibit in greater detail the condition of the department in its various branches and the progress which has been made in its administration during the three first quarters of the year i transmit a return of the militia of the several states according to the last reports which have been made by the proper officers in each to the department of war by reference to this return it will be seen that it is not complete although great exertions have been made to make it so as the defense and even the liberties of the country must depend in times of imminent danger on the militia it is of the highest importance that it be well organized armed and disciplined throughout the union the report of the secretary of war shews the progress made during the three first quarters of the present year by the application of the fund appropriated for arming the militia much difficulty is found in distributing the arms according to the act of congress providing for it from the failure of the proper departments in many of the states to make regular returns the act of 1820 05 12 provides that the system of tactics and regulations of the various corps of the regular army shall be extended to the militia this act has been very imperfectly executed from the want of uniformity in the organization of the militia proceeding from the defects of the system itself and especially in its application to that main arm of the public defense it is thought that this important subject in all its branches merits the attention of congress the report of the secretary of the navy which is now communicated furnishes an account of the administration of that department for the three first quarters of the present year with the progress made in augmenting the navy and the manner in which the vessels in commission have been employed the usual force has been maintained in the mediterranean sea the pacific ocean and along the atlantic coast and has afforded the necessary protection to our commerce in those seas in the west indies and the gulf of mexico our naval force has been augmented by the addition of several small vessels provided for by the act authorizing an additional naval force for the suppression of piracy passed by congress at their last session that armament has been eminently successful in the accomplishment of its object the piracies by which our commerce in the neighborhood of the island of cuba had been afflicted have been repressed and the confidence of our merchants in a great measure restored the patriotic zeal and enterprise of commodore porter to whom the command of the expedition was confided has been fully seconded by the officers and men under his command and in reflecting with high satisfaction on the honorable manner in which they have sustained the reputation of their country and its navy the sentiment is alloyed only by a concern that in the fulfillment of that arduous service the diseases incident to the season and to the climate in which it was discharged have deprived the nation of many useful lives and among them of several officers of great promise in the month of august a very malignant fever made its appearance at thompsons island which threatened the destruction of our station there many perished and the commanding officer was severely attacked uncertain as to his fate and knowing that most of the medical officers had been rendered incapable of discharging their duties it was thought expedient to send to that post an officer of rank and experience with several skilled surgeons to ascertain the origin of the fever and the probability of its recurrence there in future seasons to furnish every assistance to those who were suffering and if practicable to avoid the necessity of abandoning so important a station commodore rodgers with a promptitude which did him honor cheerfully accepted that trust and has discharged it in the manner anticipated from his skill and patriotism before his arrival commodore porter with the greater part of the squadron had removed from the island and returned to the united states in consequence of the prevailing sickness much useful information has however been obtained as to the state of the island and great relief afforded to those who had been necessarily left there although our expedition cooperating with an invigorated administration of the government of the island of cuba and with the corresponding active exertions of a british naval force in the same seas have almost entirely destroyed the unlicensed piracies from that island the success of our exertions has not been equally effectual to suppress the same crime under other pretenses and colors in the neighboring island of porto rico they have been committed there under the abusive issue of spanish commissions at an early period of the present year remonstrances were made to the governor of that island by an agent who was sent for the purpose against those outrages on the peaceful commerce of the united states of which many had occurred that officer professing his own want of authority to make satisfaction for our just complaints answered only by a reference of them to the government of spain the minister of the united states to that court was specially instructed to urge the necessity of immediate and effectual interposition of that government directing restitution and indemnity for wrongs already committed and interdicting the repetition of them the minister as has been seen was debarred access to the spanish government and in the mean time several new cases of flagrant outrage have occurred and citizens of the united states in the island of porto rico have suffered and others been threatened with assassination for asserting their unquestionable rights even before the lawful tribunals of the country the usual orders have been given to all our public ships to seize american vessels in the slave trade and bring them in for adjudication and i have the gratification to state that not one so employed has been discovered and there is good reason to believe that our flag is now seldom if at all disgraced by that traffic it is a source of great satisfaction that we are always enabled to recur to the conduct of our navy with price and commendation as a means of national defense it enjoys the public confidence and is steadily assuming additional importance it is submitted whether a more efficient and equally economical organization of it might not in several respects be effected it is supposed that higher grades than now exist by law would be useful they would afford well merited rewards to those who have long and faithfully served their country present the best incentives to good conduct and the best means of insuring a proper discipline destroy the inequality in that respect between military and naval services and relieve our officers from many inconveniences and mortifications which occur when our vessels meet those of other nations ours being the only service in which such grades do not exist a report of the postmaster general which accompanies this communication will shew the present state of the post office department and its general operations for some years past there is established by law 88 600 miles of post roads on which the mail is now transported 85 700 miles and contracts have been made for its transportation on all the established routes with one or 2 exceptions there are 5 240 post offices in the union and as many post masters the gross amount of postage which accrued from 1822 07 01 to 1823 07 01 was 1 114 345 12 during the same period the expenditures of the post office department amounted to 1 169 885 51 and consisted of the following items viz compensation to post masters 353 995 98 incidental expenses 30 866 37 transportation of the mail 784 600 08 payments into the treasury 423 08 on the first of july last there was due to the department from post masters 135 245 28 from late post masters and contractors 256 749 31 making a total amount of balances due to the department of 391 994 59 these balances embrace all delinquencies of post masters and contractors which have taken place since the organization of the department there was due by the department to contractors on the first of july last 26 548 64 the transportation of the mail within five years past has been greatly extended and the expenditures of the department proportionably increased although the postage which has accrued within the last three years has fallen short of the expenditures 262 821 46 it appears that collections have been made from the outstanding balances to meet the principal part of the current demands it is estimated that not more than 250 000 of the above balances can be collected and that a considerable part of this sum can only be realized by a resort to legal process some improvements in the receipts for postage is expected a prompt attention to the collection of moneys received by post masters it is believed will enable the department to continue its operations without aid from the treasury unless the expenditures shall be increased by the establishment of new mail routes a revision of some parts of the post office law may be necessary and it is submitted whether it would not be proper to provide for the appointment of post masters where the compensation exceeds a certain amount by nomination to the senate as other officers of the general government are appointed having communicated my views to congress at the commencement of the last session respecting the encouragement which ought to be given to our manufactures and the principle on which it should be founded i have only to add that those views remain unchanged and that the present state of those countries with which we have the most immediate political relations and greatest commercial intercourse tends to confirm them under this impression i recommend a review of the tariff for the purpose of affording such additional protection to those articles which we are prepared to manufacture or which are more immediately connected with the defense and independence of the country the actual state of the public accounts furnishes additional evidence of the efficiency of the present system of accountability in relation to the public expenditure of the moneys drawn from the treasury since 1817 03 04 the sum remaining unaccounted for on the 30th of september last is more than 1 5m less than on the 30th of september preceding and during the same period a reduction of nearly 1m has been made in the amount of the unsettled accounts for moneys advanced previously to 1817 03 04 it will be obvious that in proportion as the mass of accounts of the latter description is diminished by settlement the difficulty of settling the residue is increased from the consideration that in many instances it can be obtained only by legal process for more precise details on this subject i refer to a report from the first comptroller of the treasury the sum which was appropriated at the last session for the repairs of the cumberland road has been applied with good effect to that object a final report has not been received from the agent who was appointed to superintend it as soon as it is received it shall be communicated to congress many patriotic and enlightened citizens who have made the subject an object of particular investigation have suggested an improvement of still greater importance they are of the opinion that the waters of the chesapeake and ohio may be connected together by one continued canal and at an expense far short of the value and importance of the object to be obtained if this could be accomplished it is impossible to calculate the beneficial consequences which would result from it a great portion of the produce of the very fertile country through which it would pass would find a market through that channel troops might be moved with great facility in war with cannon and every kind of munition and in either direction connecting the atlantic with the western country in a line passing through the seat of the national government it would contribute essentially to strengthen the bond of union itself believing as i do that congress possess the right to appropriate money for such a national object the jurisdiction remaining to the states through which the canal would pass i submit it to your consideration whether it may not be advisable to authorize by an adequate appropriation the employment of a suitable number of the officers of the corps of engineers to examine the unexplored ground during the next season and to report their opinion thereon it will likewise be proper to extend their examination to the several routes through which the waters of the ohio may be connected by canals with those of lake erie as the cumberland road will require annual repairs and congress have not thought it expedient to recommend to the states an amendment to the constitution for the purpose of vesting in the united states a power to adopt and execute a system of internal improvement it is also submitted to your consideration whether it may not be expedient to authorize the executive to enter into an arrangement with the several states through which the road passes to establish tolls each within its limits for the purpose of defraying the expense of future repairs and of providing also by suitable penalties for its protection against future injuries the act of congress of 1822 05 07 appropriated the sum of 22 700 for the purpose of erecting two piers as a shelter for vessels from ice near cape henlopen delaware bay to effect the object of the act the officers of the board of engineers with commodore bainbridge were directed to prepare plans and estimates of piers sufficient to answer the purpose intended by the act it appears by their report which accompanies the documents from the war department that the appropriation is not adequate to the purpose intended and as the piers would be of great service both to the navigation of the delaware bay and the protection of vessels on the adjacent parts of the coast i submit for the consideration of congress whether additional and sufficient appropriations should not be made the board of engineers were also directed to examine and survey the entrance of the harbor of the port of presquille in pa in order to make an estimate of the expense of removing the obstructions to the entrance with a plan of the best mode of effecting the same under the appropriation for that purpose by act of congress passed 3rd of march last the report of the board accompanies the papers from the war department and is submitted for the consideration of congress a strong hope has been long entertained founded on the heroic struggle of the greeks that they would succeed in their contest and resume their equal station among the nations of the earth it is believed that the whole civilized world take a deep interest in their welfare although no power has declared in their favor yet none according to our information has taken part against them their cause and their name have protected them from dangers which might ere this have overwhelmed any other people the ordinary calculations of interest and of acquisition with a view to aggrandizement which mingles so much in the transactions of nations seem to have had no effect in regard to them from the facts which have come to our knowledge there is good cause to believe that their enemy has lost forever all dominion over them that greece will become again an independent nation that she may obtain that rank is the object of our most ardent wishes it was stated at the commencement of the last session that a great effort was then making in spain and portugal to improve the condition of the people of those countries and that it appeared to be conducted with extraordinary moderation it need scarcely be remarked that the result has been so far very different from what was then anticipated of events in that quarter of the globe with which we have so much intercourse and from which we derive our origin we have always been anxious and interested spectators the citizens of the united states cherish sentiments the most friendly in favor of the liberty and happiness of their fellow men on that side of the atlantic in the wars of the european powers in matters relating to themselves we have never taken any part nor does it comport with our policy so to do it is only when our rights are invaded or seriously menaced that we resent injuries or make preparation for our defense with the movements in this hemisphere we are of necessity more immediately connected and by causes which must be obvious to all enlightened and impartial observers the political system of the allied powers is essentially different in this respect from that of america this difference proceeds from that which exists in their respective governments and to the defense of our own which has been achieved by the loss of so much blood and treasure and matured by the wisdom of their most enlightened citizens and under which we have enjoyed unexampled felicity this whole nation is devoted we owe it therefore to candor and to the amicable relations existing between the united states and those powers to declare that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety with the existing colonies or dependencies of any european power we have not interfered and shall not interfere but with the governments who have declared their independence and maintained it and whose independence we have on great consideration and on just principles acknowledged we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them or controlling in any other manner their destiny by any european power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the united states in the war between those new governments and spain we declared our neutrality at the time of their recognition and to this we have adhered and shall continue to adhere provided no change shall occur which in the judgment of the competent authorities of this government shall make a corresponding change on the part of the united states indispensable to their security the late events in spain and portugal shew that europe is still unsettled of this important fact no stronger proof can be adduced than that the allied powers should have thought it proper on any principle satisfactory to themselves to have interposed by force in the internal concerns of spain to what extent such interposition may be carried on the same principle is a question in which all independent powers whose governments differ from theirs are interested even those most remote and surely none more so than the united states our policy in regard to europe which was adopted at an early stage of the wars which have so long agitated that quarter of the globe nevertheless remains the same which is not to interfere in the internal concerns of any of its powers to consider the government de facto as the legitimate government for us to cultivate friendly relations with it and to preserve those relations by a frank firm and manly policy meeting in all instances the just claims of every power submitting to injuries from none but in regard to those continents circumstances are eminently and conspicuously different it is impossible that the allied powers should extend their political system to any portion of either continent without endangering our peace and happiness nor can anyone believe that our southern brethren if left to themselves would adopt it of their own accord it is equally impossible therefore that we should behold such interposition in any form with indifference if we look to the comparative strength and resources of spain and those new governments and their distance from each other it must be obvious that she can never subdue them it is still the true policy of the united states to leave the parties to themselves in the hope that other powers will pursue the same course if we compare the present condition of our union with its actual state at the close of our revolution the history of the world furnishes no example of a progress in improvement in all the important circumstances which constitute the happiness of a nation which bears any resemblance to it at the first epoch our population did not exceed 3 000 000 by the last census it amounted to about 10 000 000 and what is more extraordinary it is almost altogether native for the immigration from other countries has been inconsiderable at the first epoch half the territory within our acknowledged limits was uninhabited and a wilderness since then new territory has been acquired of vast extent comprising within it many rivers particularly the mississippi the navigation of which to the ocean was of the highest importance to the original states over this territory our population has expanded in every direction and new states have been established almost equal in number to those which formed the first bond of our union this expansion of our population and accession of new states to our union have had the happiest effect on all its highest interests that it has eminently augmented our resources and added to our strength and respectability as a power is admitted by all but it is not in these important circumstances only that this happy effect is felt it is manifest that by enlarging the basis of our system and increasing the number of states the system itself has been greatly strengthened in both its branches consolidation and disunion have thereby been rendered equally impracticable each government confiding in its own strength has less to apprehend from the other and in consequence each enjoying a greater freedom of action is rendered more efficient for all the purposes for which it was instituted it is unnecessary to treat here of the vast improvement made in the system itself by the adoption of this constitution and of its happy effect in elevating the character and in protecting the rights of the nation as well as individuals to what then do we owe these blessings it is known to all that we derive them from the excellence of our institutions ought we not then to adopt every measure which may be necessary to perpetuate them

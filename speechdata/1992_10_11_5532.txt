jim lehrer good evening and welcome to the first of three debates among the major candidates for president of the united states sponsored by the commission on presidential debates the candidates are independent candidate ross perot governor bill clinton the democratic nominee and president george bush the republican nominee i am jim lehrer of the macneil lehrer newshour on pbs and i will be the moderator for this 90 minute event which is taking place before an audience here in the athletic complex on the campus of washington university in st louis missouri three journalists will be asking questions tonight they are john mashek of the boston globe ann compton of abc news and sander vanocur a freelance journalist we will follow a format agreed to by representatives of the clinton and bush campaigns that agreement contains no restrictions on the content or subject matter of the questions each candidate will have up to 2 minutes for a closing statement the order of those as well as the questioning was determined by a drawing the first question goes to mr perot he will have 2 minutes to answer to be followed by rebuttals of one minute each from governor clinton and then president bush distinction among candidates gentlemen good evening the first topic tonight is what separates each of you from the other mr perot what do you believe tonight is the single most important separating issue of this campaign mr perot i think the principal issue that separates me is that 5 1 2 million people came together on their own and put me on the ballot i was not put on the ballot by either of the two parties i was not put on the ballot by any pac money by any foreign lobbyist money by any special interest money this is a movement that came from the people this is the way the framers of the constitution intended our government to be a government that comes from the people over time we have developed a government that comes at the people that comes from the top down where the people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during the campaign with commercials and media events and fear messages and personal attacks and things of that nature the thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them i go into this race as their servant and i belong to them so this comes from the people mr lehrer governor clinton one minute response governor clinton the most important distinction in this campaign is that i represent real hope for change a departure from trickle down economics a departure from tax and spend economics to invest and grow but before i can do that i must challenge the american people to change and they must decide tonight i say to the president mr bush for 12 years you ve had it your way you ve had your chance and it didn t work it s time to change i want to bring that change to the american people but we must all decide first we have the courage to change for hope and a better tomorrow mr lehrer president bush one minute response sir president bush well i think one thing that distinguishes is experience i think we ve dramatically changed the world i ll talk about that a little bit later but the changes are mind boggling for world peace kids go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war and change for change s sake isn t enough we saw that message in the late seventies when we heard a lot about change and what happened that misery index went right through the roof but my economic program i think is the kind of change we want and the way we re going to get it done is we re going to have a brandnew congress a lot of them are thrown out because of all the scandals i ll sit down with them democrats and republicans alike and work for my agenda for american renewal which represents real change but i d say if you had to separate out i think it s experience at this level experience mr lehrer governor clinton how do you respond to the president you have 2 minutes on the question of experience he says that is what distinguishes him from the other two of you governor clinton i believe experience counts but it s not everything values judgment and the record that i have amassed in my state also should count for something i ve worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people my state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year fourth in income growth fourth in the reduction of poverty third in overall economic performance according to a major news magazine that s because we believe in investing in education and in jobs we have to change in this country you know my wife hillary gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result we have got to have the courage to change experience is important yes i ve gotten a lot of good experience in dealing with ordinary people over the last year and a month i ve touched more people s lives and seen more heartbreak and hope more pain and more promise than anybody else who s run for president this year and i think the american people deserve better than they re getting we have gone from first to 13th in the world in wages in the last 12 years since mr bush and mr reagan have been in personal income has dropped while people have worked harder in the last 4 years there have been twice as many bankruptcies as new jobs created we need a new approach the same old experience is not relevant we re living in a new world after the cold war and what works in this new world is not trickle down not government for the benefit of the privileged few not tax and spend but a commitment to invest in american jobs and american education controlling american health care costs and bringing the american people together that is what works and you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience mine is rooted in the real lives of real people and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change mr lehrer president bush one minute to respond president bush i just thought of another another big difference here between me i don t believe mr perot feels this way but i know governor clinton did because i want to accurately quote him he thinks i think he said that the country is coming apart at the seams now i know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economy is worse than it is but this country s not coming apart at the seams for heaven sakes we re the united states of america in spite of the economic problems we are the most respected economy around the world many would trade for it we ve been caught up in a global slowdown we can do much much better but we ought not to try to convince the american people that america is a country that s coming apart at the seams i would hate to be running for president and think that the only way i could win would be to convince everybody how horrible things are yes there are big problems and yes people are hurting but i believe that this agenda for american renewal i have is the answer to do it and i believe we can get it done now whereas we didn t in the past because you re going to have a whole brandnew bunch of people in the congress that are going to have to listen to the same american people i m listening to mr lehrer mr perot a minute response sir mr perot well they ve got a point i don t have any experience in running up a 4 trillion debt i don t have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else i don t have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world the most violent crime ridden society in the industrialized world but i do have a lot of experience in getting things done so if we re at a point in history where we want to stop talking about it and do it i ve got a lot of experience in figuring out how to solve problems making the solutions work and then moving on to the next one i ve got a lot of experience in not taking 10 years to solve a 10 minute problem so if it s time for action i think i have experience that counts if it s more time for gridlock and talk and finger pointing i m the wrong man character issues mr lehrer president bush the question goes to you you have 2 minutes and the question is this are there important issues of character separating you from these other two men president bush i think the american people should be the judge of that i think character is a very important question i said something the other day where i was accused of being like joe mccarthy because i questioned put it this way i think it s wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstrations against your own country in foreign soil i just think it s wrong maybe they say well it was a youthful indiscretion i was 19 or 20 flying off an aircraft carrier and that shaped me to be commander in chief of the armed forces and i m sorry but demonstrating it s not a question of patriotism it s a question of character and judgment they get on me bill s gotten on me about read my lips when i make a mistake i ll admit it but he has not admitted the mistake and i just find it impossible to understand how an american can demonstrate against his own country in a foreign land organizing demonstrations against it when young men are held prisoner in hanoi or kids out of the ghetto were drafted some say well you re a little old fashioned maybe i am but i just don t think that s right now whether it s character or judgment whatever it is i have a big difference here on this issue and so we ll just have to see how it plays out but i couldn t do that and i don t think most americans could do that and they all say well it was a long time ago well let s admit it then say i made a terrible mistake how could you be commander in chief of the armed forces and have some kid say when you have to make a tough decision as i did in panama or in kuwait and then have some kid jump up and say well i m not going to go the commander in chief was organizing demonstrations halfway around the world during another era so there are differences but that s about the main area where i think we have a difference i don t know about we ll talk about that a little with ross here in a bit mr lehrer mr perot you have one minute mr perot i think the american people will make their own decisions on character and at a time when we have work to do and we need action i think they need to clearly understand the backgrounds of each person i think the press can play a huge role in making sure that the backgrounds are clearly presented in an objective way then make a decision certainly anyone in the white house should have the character to be there but i think it s very important to measure when and where things occurred did they occur when you were a young person in your formative years or did they occur while you were a senior official in the federal government when you re a senior official in the federal government spending billions of dollars in taxpayers money and you re a mature individual and you make a mistake then that was on our ticket if you make it as a young man time passes so i would say just look at all three of us decide who you think will do the job pick that person in november because believe me as i ve said before the party s over and it s time for the cleanup crew and we do have to have change and people who never take responsibility for anything when it happens on their watch and people who are in charge mr lehrer your time is up mr perot the time is up mr lehrer time is up mr perot more later mr lehrer governor clinton you have one minute governor clinton ross gave a good answer but i ve got to respond directly to mr bush you have questioned my patriotism you even brought some right wing congressmen into the white house to plot how to attack me for going to russia in 1969 1970 when over 50 000 other americans did now i honor your service in world war ii i honor mr perot s service in uniform and the service of every man and woman who ever served including admiral crowe who was your chairman of the joint chiefs and who s supporting me but when joe mccarthy went around this country attacking people s patriotism he was wrong he was wrong and a senator from connecticut stood up to him named prescott bush your father was right to stand up to joe mccarthy you were wrong to attack my patriotism i was opposed to the war but i love my country and we need a president who will bring this country together not divide it we ve had enough division i want to lead a unified country mr lehrer all right we move now to the subject of taxes and spending the question goes to governor clinton for a two minute answer it will be asked by ann compton taxes ann compton governor clinton can you lock in a level here tonight on where middle income families can be guaranteed a tax cut or at the very least at what income level they can be guaranteed no tax increase governor clinton the tax increase i have proposed triggers in at family incomes of 200 000 and above those are the people who in the 1980 s had their incomes go up while their taxes went down middle class people defined as people with incomes of 52 000 and down had their incomes go down while their taxes went up in the reagan bush years because of six increases in the payroll taxes so that is where my income limit would trigger ms compton so there will be no tax increases below 200 000 governor clinton my plan notwithstanding my opponent s ad my plan triggers in at gross incomes family incomes of 200 000 and above and then we want to give modest middle class tax relief to restore some fairness especially to middle class people with families with incomes of under 60 000 in addition to that the money that i raise from upper income people and from asking foreign corporations just to pay the same income on their income earned in america that american corporations do will be used to give incentives back to upper income people i want to give people permanent incentives on investment tax credit like president kennedy and the congress inaugurated in the early sixties to get industry moving again a research and development tax credit a low income housing tax credit a long term capital gains proposal for new business and business expansions we ve got to have no more trickle down we don t need across the board tax cuts for the wealthy for nothing we need to say here s your tax incentive if you create american jobs the old fashioned way i d like to create more millionaires than were created under mr bush and mr reagan but i don t want to have 4 years where we have no growth in the private sector and that s what s happened in the last 4 years we re down 35 000 jobs in the private sector we need to invest and grow and that s what i want to do mr lehrer president bush one minute sir president bush i have to correct one thing i didn t question the man s patriotism i questioned his judgment and his character what he did in moscow that s fine let him explain it he did i accept that what i don t accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your country s at war i m sorry i cannot accept that this one on taxes spells out the biggest difference between us i do not believe we need to go back to the mondale proposals or the dukakis proposals of tax and spend governor clinton says 200 000 but he also says he wants to raise 150 billion taxing people over 200 000 will not get you 150 billion and then when you add in his other spending proposals regrettably you end up socking it to the working man that old adage that they use we re going to soak the rich we re going to soak the rich it always ends up being the poor cab driver or the working man that ends up paying the bill and so i just have a different approach i believe the way to get the deficit down is to control the growth of mandatory spending programs and not raise taxes on the american people we ve got a big difference there mr lehrer mr perot one minute mr perot we ve got to have a growing expanding job base to give us a growing expanding tax base right now we have a flat to deteriorating job base and where it appears to be growing is minimum wage jobs so we ve got to really rebuild our job base that s going to take money for infrastructure and investment to do that our foreign competitors are doing it we re not we cannot pay off the 4 trillion debt balance the budget and have the industries of the future and the high paying jobs in this country without having the revenue we re going to go through a period of shared sacrifice there s one challenge it s got to be fair we ve created a mess and don t have much to show for it and we have got to fix it and that s about all i can say in a minute mr lehrer okay next question goes to president bush for a 2 minute answer and it will be asked by sandy vanocur u s troops in europe sander vanocur mr president this past week your secretary of the army michael stone said he had no plans to abide by a congressional mandate to cut u s forces in europe from 150 000 to 100 000 by the end of september 1996 now why almost 50 years after the end of world war ii and with the total collapse of the soviet union should american taxpayers be taxed support armies in europe when the europeans have plenty of money to do it for themselves president bush well sander that s a good question and the answer is for 40 some years we kept the peace if you look at the cost of not keeping the peace in europe it would be exorbitant we have reduced the number of troops that are deployed and going to be deployed i have cut defense spending and the reason we could do that is because of our fantastic success in winning the cold war we never would have got there if we d gone for the nuclear freeze crowd never would have got there if we d listened to those that wanted to cut defense spending i think it is important that the united states stay in europe and continue to guarantee the peace we simply cannot pull back now when anybody has a spending program they want to spend money on at home they say well let s cut money out of the defense department i will accept and have accepted the recommendations of two proven leaders general colin powell and dick secretary dick cheney they feel that the levels we re operating at and the reductions that i have proposed are proper and so i simply do not think we should go back to the isolation days and start blaming foreigners we are the sole remaining superpower and we should be that we have a certain disproportionate responsibility but i would ask the american people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts if we go too far we risk the peace and i don t want to do that i ve seen what it is like to see the burdens of a war and i don t want to see us make reckless cuts because of our programs we have been able to significantly cut defense spending but let s not cut into the muscle and let s not cut down our insurance policy which is participation of american forces in nato the greatest peacekeeping organization ever made today you ve got problems in europe still bubbling along even though europe s going democracy s route but we are there and i think this insurance policy is necessary i think it goes with world leadership and i think the levels we ve come up with are just about right mr lehrer mr perot one minute sir mr perot if i m poor and you re rich and i can get you to defend me that s good but when the tables get turned i ought to do my share right now we spend about 300 billion a year on defense the japanese spend around 30 billion in asia the germans spend around 30 billion in europe for example germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over the next 10 years it s kind of easy to do if you only have to pick up a 30 billion tab to defend your country the european community is in a position to pay a lot more than they have in the past i agree with the president when they couldn t we should have now that they can they should we sort of seem to have a desire to try to stay over there and control it they don t want us to control it very candidly so it i think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure because we can only be a superpower if we are an economic superpower and we can only be an economic superpower if we have a growing expanding job base mr lehrer governor clinton one minute sir governor clinton i agree with the general statement mr bush made i disagree that we need 150 000 troops to fulfill our role in europe we certainly must maintain an engagement there there are certainly dangers there there are certainly other trouble spots in the world which are closer to europe than to the united states but two former defense secretaries recently issued reports saying that 100 000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough including president reagan s former defense secretary mr carlucci many of the military experts whom i consulted on this agreed we re going to have to spend more money in the future on military technology and on greater mobility greater airlift greater sealift the b 22 airplane we re going to have to do some things that are quite costly and i simply don t believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150 000 troops in europe given how much the red army now under the control of russia has been cut the arms control agreement concluded between mr bush and mr yeltsin something i have applauded i don t think we need 150 000 troops let me make one other point mr bush talked about taxes he didn t tell you that he vetoed a middle class tax cut because it would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and vetoed an investment tax credit paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy taxes mr lehrer all right we go now to mr perot for a 2 minute question and it will be asked by john mashek john mashek mr perot you talked about fairness just a minute ago on sharing the pain as part of your plan to reduce the ballooning federal deficit you ve suggested that we raise gasoline taxes 50 cents a gallon over 5 years why punish the middle class consumer to such a degree mr perot it s 10 cents a year cumulative it finally gets to 50 cents at the end of the fifth year i think punish is the wrong word again you see i didn t create this problem we re trying to solve it now if you study our international competitors some of our international competitors collect up to 3 50 a gallon in taxes and they use that money to build infrastructure and create jobs we collect 35 cents and we don t have it to spend i know it s not popular and i understand the nature of your question but the people who will be helped the most by it are the working people who will get the jobs created because of this tax why do we have to do it because we have so mismanaged our country over the years and it is now time to pay the fiddler and if we don t we will be spending our children s money we have spent 4 trillion worth an incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they re deeply concerned that we have taken the american dream from them i think it s fitting that we re on the campus of a university tonight these young people when they get out of this wonderful university will have difficulty finding a job we ve got to clean this mess up leave this country in good shape and pass on the american dream to them we re got to collect the taxes to do it if there s a fairer way i m all ears ah h h but see let me make it very clear people don t have the stomach to fix these problems i think it s a good time to face it in november if they do then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do i m not playing lawrence welk music tonight mr lehrer governor clinton you have a minute sir governor clinton i think mr perot has confronted this deficit issue but i think it s important to point out that we really have two deficits in america not one we have a budget deficit in the federal government but we also have an investment a jobs an income deficit people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago two thirds of our people a 1 600 drop in average income in just the last 2 years the problem i have with the perot prescription is that almost all economists who have looked at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment it will slow down the economy that s why i think we shouldn t do it that quickly we have a disciplined reduction in the deficit of 50 percent over the next 4 years but first get incentives to invest in this economy put the american people back to work we ve got to invest in growth nine nobel prize winning economists and 500 others including numerous republican and democratic business executives have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put america back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling mr lehrer president bush one minute sir president bush the question was on fairness i just disagree with mr perot i don t believe it is fair to slap a 50 cent a gallon tax over whatever many years on the people that have to drive for a living people that go long distances i don t think we need to do it you see i have a fundamental difference i agree with what he s talking about in trying to get the spending down and to discipline although i think we ought to totally exempt social security but he s talking tough medicine and i think that s good i disagree with the tax and spend philosophy you see i don t think we need to tax more and spend more and then say that s going to make the problem better and i m afraid that s what i think i m hearing from governor clinton i believe what you need to do is some of what ross is talking about control the growth of mandatory spending and get taxes down he s mentioned some ways to do it and i agree with those i ve been talking about getting a capital gains cut forever and his friends in congress have been telling me that s a tax break for the rich it would stimulate investment i m for an investment tax allowance i am for a tax break for first time homebuyers and with this new congress coming in gridlock will be gone and i ll sit down with them and say let s get this done but i do not want to go the tax and spend route mr lehrer all right let s move on now to the subject of jobs the first question goes to president bush for 2 minutes and john will ask that question john the defense industry mr mashek mr president last month you came to st louis to announce a very lucrative contract for mcdonnell douglas to build f 15 s for saudi arabia in today s post dispatch a retired saleswoman a 75 year old woman named marjorie roberts asked if she could ask a question of the candidates said she wanted to register her concern about the lack of a plan to convert our defense oriented industries into other purposes how would you answer her president bush well i assume she was supportive of the decision on mcdonnell douglas i assume she was supporting me on the decision to sell those airplanes i think it s a good decision i took a little heat for it but i think it was the correct decision to do and we ve worked it out and indeed we re moving forward all around the world in a much more peaceful way so that one we came away with which in creating jobs for the american people i would simply say to her look take a look at what the president has proposed on job retraining when you cut back on defense spending some people are going to be thrown out of work if you throw another 50 000 kids on the street because of cutting recklessly in troop levels you re going to put a lot more out of work i would say to them look at the job retraining programs that we re proposing therein is the best answer to her and another one is stimulate investment and savings i mean we ve got big economic problems but we are not coming apart at the seams we re ready for a recovery with interest rates down and inflation down the cruelest tax of all caught up in a global slowdown right now but that will change if you go with the programs i ve talked about and if you help with job retraining and education i am a firm believer that our america 2000 education problem is the answer a little longer run it s going to take a while to educate but it is a good program so her best hope for short term is job retraining if she was thrown out of work at a defense plant but tell her it s not all that gloomy we re the united states we ve faced tough problems before look at the misery index when the democrats had both the white house and the congress it was just right through the roof now we can do better and the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain get that control of the mandatory spending programs i am much more optimistic about this country than some mr lehrer mr perot you have one minute sir mr perot your defense industries are going to have to convert to civilian industries many of them are and the sooner they start the sooner they ll finish and there will be a significant transition and it s very important that we not continue to let our industrial base deteriorate we had someone who i m sure regrets said it in the president s staff said he didn t care whether we make potato chips or computer chips well anybody that thinks about it cares a great deal number one you make more making computer chips than you do potato chips number two 19 out of 20 computer chips that we have in this country now come from japan we ve given away whole industries so as we phase these industries over there s a lot of intellectual talent in these industries a lot of these people in industries can be converted to the industries of tomorrow and that s where the high paying jobs are we need to have a very carefully thought through phaseover see we practice 19th century capitalism the rest of the world practices 21st century capitalism i can t handle that in a minute but i hope we can get back into it later the rest of the world the countries and the businesses would be working together to make this transition in an intelligent way mr lehrer governor clinton you have one minute sir governor clinton we must have a transition plan a plan to convert from a defense to a domestic economy no other nation would have cut defense as much as we already have without that there are 200 000 people unemployed in california alone because we have cut defense without planning to retrain them and to reinvest in the technologies of the future here at home that is what i want to do this administration may say they have a plan but the truth is they have not even released all the money the paltry sum of money that congress appropriated i want to take every dollar by which we reduced defense and reinvest it in technologies for the 21st century in new transportation in communication and environmental cleanup technologies let s put the american people to work and let s build the kind of high tech high wage high growth economy that the american people deserve mr lehrer all right the next question goes to mr perot for a 2 minute answer it will be asked by ann ann jobs program ms compton mr perot you talked a minute ago about rebuilding the job base but is it true what governor clinton just said that that means that unemployment will increase that it will slow the economy and how would you specifically use the powers of the presidency to get more people back into good jobs immediately mr perot step one the american people send me up there the day after election i ll get with the we won t even wait until inauguration i ll ask the president to help me and i ll ask his staff to help me and we will start putting together teams to put together to take all the plans that exist and do something with them please understand there are great plans lying all over washington nobody ever executes it s like having a blueprint for a house you never built you don t have anywhere to sleep now our challenge is to take these things do something with them step one you want to put america back to work clean up the small business problem have one task force at work on that the second you ve got your big companies that are in trouble including the defense industries have another one on that have a third task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they don t wind up in europe and asia convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism you see we have an adversarial relationship between government and business our international competitors that are cleaning our plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business and a supportive relationship then have another task force on crime because next to jobs our people are concerned about their safety health care schools one on the debt and deficit and finally in that 90 day period before the inauguration put together the framework for the town hall and give the american people a christmas present show them by christmas the first cut at these plans by the time congress comes into session to go to work have those plans ready to go in front of congress then get off to a flying start in 93 to execute these plans now there are people in this room and people on this stage who have been in meetings when i would sit there and say is this one we re going to talk about or do something about well obviously my orientation is let s go do it now put together your plans by christmas be ready to go when congress goes nail these things small business you ve got to have capital you ve got to have credit and many of them need mentors or coaches and we can create more jobs there in a hurry than any other place mr lehrer governor clinton one minute governor clinton this country desperately needs a jobs program and my first priority would be to pass a jobs program to introduce it on the first day i was inaugurated i would meet with the leaders of the congress with all the newly elected members of the congress and as many others with whom i could meet between the time of the election and the inauguration and we would present a jobs program then we would present a plan to control health care costs and phase in health care coverage for all americans until we control health care costs we re not going to control the deficit it is the number one culprit but first we must have an aggressive jobs program i live in a state where manufacturing job growth has far outpaced the nation in the last few years where we have created more private sector jobs since mr bush has been president than have been created in the entire rest of the country where mr bush s labor secretary said the job growth has been enormous we ve done it in arkansas give me a chance to create these kinds of jobs in america we can do it i know we can mr lehrer president bush one minute president bush well we ve got a plan announced for what we can do for small business i ve already put forward things that will get this country working fast some of which have been echoed here tonight investment tax allowance capital gains reduction more on research and development a tax credit for first time homebuyers what i m going to do is say to jim baker when this campaign is over all right let s sit down now you do in domestic affairs what you ve done in foreign affairs be the kind of economic coordinator of all the domestic side of the house and that includes all the economic side all the training side and bring this program together we re going to have a new congress and we re going to say to them you ve listened to the voters the way we have nobody wants gridlock anymore and so let s get the program through and i believe it will work because as ross said we ve got the plans the plans are all over washington and i have put ours together in something called the agenda for american renewal and it makes sense it s sensible it creates jobs it gets to the base of the kind of jobs we need and so i ll just be asking for support to get that put into effect mr lehrer the next question goes to governor clinton for 2 minutes it will be asked by sandy federal reserve board chairman mr vanocur governor clinton when a president running for the first time gets into the office and wants to do something about the economy he finds in washington there s a person who has much more power over the economy than he does the chairman of the federal reserve board accountable to no one that being the case would you go along with proposals made by treasury secretary james brady and congressman lee hamilton to make the federal reserve board chairman somehow more accountable to elected officials governor clinton well let me say that i think that we might ought to review the terms and the way it works but frankly i don t think that s the problem today we have low interest rates today at least we have low interest rates that the fed can control our long term interest rates are still pretty high because of our deficit and because of our economic performance and there was a terrible reaction internationally to mr bush saying he was going to give us 4 more years of trickle down economics and other across the board tax cuts and most of it going to the wealthy with no real guarantee of investment but i think the important thing is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that given the condition of this economy we re going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time that is my commitment i think the american people are hungry for action i think congress is hungry for someone who will work with them instead of manipulate them someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment credit middle class tax relief research and development tax credits as mr bush has done give me a chance to do that i don t have to worry i don t think in the near term about the federal reserve their policies so far it seems to me are pretty sound mr lehrer president bush you have one minute president bush i don t think the fed ought to be put under the executive branch there is separation there i think that s fine alan greenspan is respected i ve had some arguments with him about the speed in which we might have lowered rates but governor clinton he talks about the reaction to the markets there was a momentary fear that he might win and the markets went rrrfft down like that so i don t we can judge on the stock market has been strong it s been very strong since i ve been president and they recognize we ve got great difficulties but they re also much more optimistic than the pessimists we have up here tonight in terms of vetoing tax bills you re darn right i am going to protect the american taxpayer against the spend and tax congress and i m going to keep on vetoing them because i don t think we are taxed too little i think the government s spending too much so governor clinton can label it tax for the rich or anything he wants i m going to protect the working man by continuing to veto and to threaten veto until we get this new congress when then we re going to move forward on our plan i ve got to protect them mr lehrer mr perot one minute mr perot keep the federal reserve independent but let s live in a world of reality we live in a global economy not a national economy these interest rates we have now don t make any sense we have a 4 trillion debt and only in america would you finance 70 percent of it 5 years or less so 70 percent of our debt is 5 years or less it s very interest sensitive we have a 4 percent gap between what we pay for treasuries and what germany pays for 1 to 5 year treasuries that gap is going to close because the arabs the japanese and folks in this country are going to start buying german treasuries because they can get more money every time our interest rates go up 1 percent that adds 28 billion to the deficit or to the debt whichever place you want to put it we are sitting on a ticking bomb folks because we have totally mismanaged our country and we had better get it back under control just think in your own business if you had all of your long term problems financed short term you d go broke in a hurry mr lehrer we re going to move to foreign affairs the first question goes to mr perot for a 2 minute answer and sandy will ask it foreign affairs mr vanocur mr perot in the post cold war environment what should be the overriding u s national interest and what can the united states do and what can it afford to do to defend that national interest mr perot again if you re not rich you re not a superpower so we have two that i d put as number one i have a 1 and 1a one is we ve got to have the money to be able to pay for defense and we ve got to manufacture here believe it or not folks you can t ship it all overseas you ve got to make it here and you can t convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency you see willow run could be converted from cars to airplanes in world war ii because it was here we ve got to make things here you just can t ship them overseas anymore i hope we talk more about that second thing on priorities we ve got to help russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics when we think of russia remember we re thinking of many countries now we ve got to help them that s pennies on the dollar compared to renewing the cold war third we ve got all kinds of agreements on paper and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads russia and its republics are out of control or at best in weak control right now it s a very unstable situation you ve got every rich middle eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons as you well know and that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road we really need to nail down the intercontinental ballistic missiles the ones that can hit us from russia we ve focused on the tactical we ve made real progress there we ve got some agreements on the nuclear but we don t have those things put away yet the sooner the better so in terms of priorities we ve got to be financially strong number two we ve got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give that a very high priority and number three we need to help and support russia and the republics in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic societies and not just sit back and let those countries continue in turmoil because they could go back worse than things used to be and believe me there are a lot of old boys in the kgb and the military that like it better the way it used to be thank you mr lehrer governor clinton one minute governor clinton in order to keep america the strongest nation in the world we need some continuity and some change there are three fundamental challenges first of all the world is still a dangerous and uncertain place we need a new military and a new national security policy equal to the challenges of the post cold war era a smaller permanent military force but one that is more mobile well trained with high technology equipment we need to continue the negotiations to reduce nuclear arsenals in the soviet union the former soviet union and the united states we need to stop this proliferation of weapons of mass destruction second we have to face that in this world economic security is a whole lot of national security our dollar is at an all time low against some foreign currencies we re weak in the world we must rebuild america s strength at home finally we ought to be promoting the democratic impulses around the world democracies are our partners they don t go to war with each other they re reliable friends in the future national security economic strength democracy mr lehrer president bush one minute president bush we still are the envy of the world in terms of our military there s no question about that we re the envy of the world in terms of our economy in spite of the difficulties we re having there s no question about that our exports are dramatically up i might say to mr perot i can understand why you might have missed it because there s so much fascination by trivia but i worked out a deal with boris yeltsin to eliminate get rid of entirely the most destabilizing weapons of all the ss 18 the big intercontinental ballistic missile i mean that s been done and thank god it has because the parents of these young people around here go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war we ve made dramatic progress so we ve got a good military the question that says get a new military get the best in the world we ve got it and they re keeping the peace they re respected around the world and we are more respected because of the way we have conducted ourselves we didn t listen to the nuclear freeze crowd we said peace through strength it worked and the cold war is over america understands that but we re turned so inward we don t understand the global picture we are helping democracy ross the freedom support act is something that i got through the congress and it s a very good thing because it does exactly what you say and i think you agree with that to help russian democracy we re going to keep on doing that mr lehrer all right next question is for governor clinton and john will ask it china u s relations mr mashek governor clinton you ve accused the president of coddling tyrants including those in beijing as president how would you exert u s power to influence affairs in china governor clinton i think our relation ships with china are important and i don t think we want to isolate china but i think it is a mistake for us to do what this administration did when all those kids went out there carrying the statue of liberty in tiananmen square and mr bush sent two people in secret to toast the chinese leaders and basically tell them not to worry about it they rewarded him by opening negotiations with iran to transfer nuclear technology that was their response to that sort of action now that voices in the congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about china look what has happened china has finally agreed to stop sending us products made with prison labor not because we coddled them but because the administration was pushed into doing something about it recently the chinese have announced that they re going to lower some barriers to our products which they ought to do since they have a 15 billion trade surplus with the united states under mr bush the second biggest surplus of all second to japan so i would be firm i would say if you want to continue most favored nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones observe human rights in the future open your society recognize the legitimacy of those kids that were carrying the statue of liberty if we can stand up for our economic interests we ought to be able to pursue the democratic interests of the people in china and over the long run they ll be more reliable partners mr lehrer president bush you have one minute president bush well the administration was the first major country to stand up against the abuse in tiananmen square we are the ones that worked out the prison labor deal we are the ones that have lowered the barrier to products the carla hills negotiation i am the one that said let s keep the mfn because you see china moving toward a free market economy to do what the congress and governor clinton are suggesting you would isolate and ruin hong kong they are making some progress not enough for us we were the first ones to put sanctions on we still have them on some things but governor clinton s philosophy is isolate them he says don t do it but the policies he s expounding of putting conditions on mfn and kind of humiliating them is not the way you make the kind of progress we are getting i have stood up with these people and i understand what you have to do to be strong in this situation it s moving not as fast as we d like but you isolate china and turn them inward and then we ve made a tremendous mistake i m not going to do it i ve had to fight a lot of people that were saying human rights we are the ones that put the sanctions on and stood for it and he can insult general scowcroft if he wants to he didn t go over to coddle he went over to say mr lehrer mr president you re over president bush you must make the very changes they re making now mr lehrer one minute mr perot mr perot china s a huge country broken into many provinces it has some very elderly leaders that will not be around too much longer capitalism is growing and thriving across big portions of china asia will be our largest trading partner in the future it will be a growing and a closer relationship we have a delicate tightwire walk that we must go through at the present time to make sure that we do not cozy up to tyrants to make sure that they don t get the impression that they can suppress their people but time is our friend there because their leaders will change in not too many years worst case and their country is making great progress one last point on the missiles i don t want the american people to be confused we have written agreements and we have some missiles that have been destroyed but we have a huge number of intercontinental ballistic missiles that are still in place in russia the fact that you have an agreement is one thing until they re destroyed some crazy person can either sell them or use them mr lehrer all right the next question goes to president bush for a 2 minute answer and ann will ask it bosnia and somalia ms compton mr president how can you watch the killing in bosnia and the ethnic cleansing or the starvation and anarchy in somalia and not want to use america s might if not america s military to try to end that kind of suffering president bush ann both of them are very complicated situations i vowed something because i learned something from vietnam i am not going to commit u s forces until i know what the mission is until the military tell me that it can be completed until i know how they can come out we are helping american airplanes are helping today on humanitarian relief for sarajevo it is america that s in the lead in helping with humanitarian relief for somalia but when you go to put somebody else s son or daughter into war i think you ve got to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that there s a military plan that can do this you have ancient ethnic rivalries that have cropped up as yugoslavia is dissolved or getting dissolved it isn t going to be solved by sending in the 82d airborne and i m not going to do that as commander in chief i am going to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the united states to get satisfaction in terms of prison camps and we re making some progress there and in terms of getting humanitarian relief in there right now as you know the united states took the lead in a no fly operation up there no fly order up in the united nations we re working through the international organizations that s one thing i learned by forging that tremendous and greatly highly successful coalition against saddam hussein the dictator work internationally to do it i m very concerned about it i m concerned about ethnic cleansing i m concerned about attacks on muslims for example over there but i must stop short of using american force until i know how those young men and women are going to get out of there as well as get in know what the mission is and define it i think i m on the right track ms compton are you designing a mission that would mr lehrer ann sorry sorry time is up we have to go to mr perot for a one minute response mr perot if we learned anything in vietnam it s you first commit this nation before you commit the troops to the battlefield we cannot send our people all over the world to solve every problem that comes up this is basically a problem that is a primary concern to the european community certainly we care about the people we care about the children we care about the tragedy but it is inappropriate for us just because there s a problem somewhere around the world to take the sons and daughters of working people and make no mistake about it our all volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people it s the working folks that send their sons and daughters to war with a few exceptions very unlike world war ii when fdr s sons flew missions everybody went it s a different world now it s very important that we not just without thinking it through just rush to every problem in the world and have our people torn to pieces mr lehrer governor clinton one minute governor clinton i agree that we cannot commit ground forces to become involved in the quagmire of bosnia or in the tribal wars of somalia but i think that it s important to recognize that there are things that can be done short of that and that we do have interests there there are after all two million refugees now because of the problems in what was yugoslavia the largest number since world war ii and there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter the united states should try to work with its allies and stop it i urged the president to support this air cover and he did and i applaud that i applaud the no fly zone and i know that he s going back to the united nations to try to get authority to enforce it i think we should stiffen the embargo on the belgrade government i think we have to consider whether or not we should lift the arms embargo now on the bosnians since they are in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on ethnic cleansing we can t get involved in the quagmire but we must do what we can mr lehrer all right moving on now to divisions in our country the first question goes to governor clinton for two minutes and ann will ask it family values ms compton governor clinton can you tell us what your definition of the word family is governor clinton a family involves at least one parent whether natural or adoptive or foster and children a good family is a place where love and discipline and good values are transmuted from the elders to the children a place where people turn for refuge and where they know they re the most important people in the world america has a lot of families that are in trouble today there s been a lot of talk about family values in this campaign i know a lot about that i was born to a widowed mother who gave me family values and grandparents i ve seen the family values of my people in arkansas i ve seen the family values of all these people in america who are out there killing themselves working harder for less in a country that s had the worst economic years in 50 years and the first decline in industrial production ever i think the president owes it to family values to show that he values america s families whether they re people on welfare you re trying to move from welfare to work the working poor whom i think deserve a tax break to lift them above poverty if they ve got a child in the house and working 40 hours a week working families who deserve a fair tax system and the opportunity for constant retraining they deserve a strong economy i think they deserve a family and medical leave act seventy two other nations have been able to do it mr bush vetoed it twice because he says we can t do something 72 other countries do even though there was a small business exemption so with all the talk about family values i know about family values i wouldn t be here without them the best expression of my family values is that tonight s my 17th wedding anniversary and i d like to close my question by just wishing my wife a happy anniversary and thanking my daughter for being here mr lehrer president bush one minute president bush well i would say that one meeting that made a profound impression on me was when the mayors of the big cities including the mayor of los angeles a democrat came to see me and they unanimously said the decline in urban america stems from the decline in the american family so i do think we need to strengthen family when barbara holds an aids baby she s showing a certain compassion for family when she reads to children the same thing i believe that discipline and respect for the law all of these things should be taught to children not in our schools but families have to do that i m appalled at the high outrageous numbers of divorces it s happened in families it s happened in ours but it s gotten too much and i just think that we ought to do everything we can to respect the american family it can be a single parent family those mothers need help one way to do it is to get these deadbeat fathers to pay their obligations to these mothers that will help strengthen the american family and there s a whole bunch of other things that i can t click off in this short period of time mr lehrer mr perot you have one minute mr perot if i had to solve all the problems that face this country and i could be granted one wish as we started down the trail to rebuild the job base the schools and so on and so forth i would say a strong family unit in every home where every child is loved nurtured and encouraged a little child before they re 18 months learns to think well of himself or herself or poorly they develop a positive or negative self image at a very early age they learn how to learn if we have children who are not surrounded with love and affection see i look at my grandchildren and wonder if they ll ever learn to walk because they re always in someone s arms i think my gosh wouldn t it be wonderful if every child had that love and support but they don t we will not be a great country unless we have a strong family unit in every home and i think you can use the white house as a bully pulpit to stress the importance of these little children particularly in their young and formative years to mold these little precious pieces of clay so that they too can live rich full lives when they re grown mr lehrer new question 2 minute answer goes to president bush sandy will ask it legalization of drugs mr vanocur mr president there s been a lot of talk about harry truman in this campaign so much so that i think tomorrow i ll wake up and see him named as the next commissioner of baseball president bush we could use one mr vanocur the thing that mr truman didn t have to deal with is drugs americans are increasingly alarmed about drug related crimes in cities and suburbs and your administration is not the first to have grappled with this are you at all of a mind that maybe it ought to go to another level if not to what s advocated by william f buckley jr and milton friedman legalization somewhere between there and where we are now president bush no i don t think that s the right answer i don t believe legalizing narcotics is the answer i just don t believe that s the answer i do believe that there s some fairly good news out there the use of cocaine for example by teenagers is dramatically down but we ve got to keep fighting on this war against drugs we re doing a little better in interdiction many of the countries that used to say well this is a united states problem if you d get the demand down then we wouldn t have the problem are working cooperatively with the dea and other law the military we re using the military more now in terms of interdiction our funding for recovery is up recovering the addicts where we re not making the progress sander is in we re making it in teenagers and thank god because i thought what ross said was most appropriate about these families and these children but where we re not making it is with the confirmed addicts i ll tell you one place that s working well and that is the private sector jim burke and this task force that he has you may know about it tell the american people but this man said i ll get you a million dollars a day in pro bono advertising something that s very hard for the government to do he went out and he did it and people are beginning to educate through this program teaching these kids you shouldn t use drugs so we re still in the fight but i must tell you i think legalization of narcotics or something of that nature in the face of the medical evidence would be totally counterproductive and i oppose it and i m going to stand up and continue to oppose it mr lehrer mr perot one minute mr perot any time you think you want to legalize drugs go to a neonatal unit if you can get in they are between 100 and 200 percent capacity up and down the east coast and the reason is crack babies being born baby s in the hospital 42 days typical cost to you and me is 125 000 again and again and again the mother disappears in 3 days and the child becomes a ward of the state because he s permanently and genetically damaged just look at those little children and if anybody can even think about legalizing drugs they ve lost me now let s look at priorities we went on the libyan raid you remember that one because we were worried to death that qadhafi might be building up chemical weapons we ve got chemical warfare being conducted against our children on the streets in this country all day every day and we don t have the will to stamp it out again if i get up there if you send me we re going to have some blunt talks about this we re really going to get out in the trenches and say is this one you want to talk about or fix because talk won t do it folks there are guys that couldn t get a job third shift in a dairy queen driving bmw s and mercedes selling drugs these old boys are not going to quit easy mr lehrer governor clinton one minute governor clinton like mr perot i have held crack babies in my arms but i know more about this i think than anybody else up here because i have a brother who s a recovering drug addict i m very proud of him but i can tell you this if drugs were legal i don t think he d be alive today i am adamantly opposed to legalizing drugs he is alive today because of the criminal justice system that s a mistake what should we do first we ought to prevent more of this on the street thirty years ago there were three policemen for every crime now there are three crimes for every policeman we need 100 000 more police on the street i have a plan for that secondly we ought to have treatment on demand thirdly we ought to have boot camps for first time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they are severed and sent to prison where they can learn how to be first class criminals there is a crime bill that lamentably was blocked from passage once again mostly by republicans in the united states senate which would have addressed some of these problems that crime bill is going to be one of my highest priorities next january if i become president mr lehrer next question is to you mr perot you have 2 minutes to answer it and john will ask it racial harmony mr mashek mr perot racial division continues to tear apart our great cities the last episode being this spring in los angeles why is this still happening in america and what would you do to end it mr perot this is a relevant question here tonight first thing i d do is during political campaigns i would urge everybody to stop trying to split this country into fragments and appeal to the differences between us and then wonder why the melting pot s all broken to pieces after november the 3d we are all in this together we ought to love one another because united teams win and divided teams lose if we can t love one another we ought to get along with one another if you can t get there just recognize we re all stuck with one another because nobody s going anywhere right now that ought to get everybody back up to let s get along together and make it work our diversity is a strength we ve turned it into a weakness now again the white house is a bully pulpit i think whoever s in the white house should just make it absolutely unconscionable and inexcusable and if anybody s in the middle of a speech at you know one of these conventions i would expect the candidate to go out and lift him off the stage if he starts preaching hate because we don t have time for it our differences are our strengths we have got to pull together in athletics we know it you see divided teams lose united teams win we have got to unite and pull together and there s nothing we can t do but if we sit around blowing all this energy out the window on racial strife and hatred we are stuck with a sure loser because we have been a melting pot we re becoming more and more of a melting pot let s make it a strength not a weakness mr lehrer governor clinton one minute governor clinton i grew up in the segregated south thankfully raised by a grandfather with almost no formal education but with a heart of gold who taught me early that all people were equal in the eyes of god i saw the winds of hatred divide people and keep the people of my state poorer than they would have been spiritually and economically i ve done everything i could in my public life to overcome racial divisions we don t have a person to waste in this country we are being murdered economically because we have too many dropouts we have too many low birth weight babies we have too many drug addicts as kids we have too much violence we are too divided by race by income by region i have devoted a major portion of this campaign to going across this country and looking for opportunities to go to white groups and african american groups and latino groups asian american groups and say the same thing if the american people cannot be brought together we can t turn this country around if we can come together nothing nothing can stop us mr lehrer mr president one minute president bush well i think governor clinton is committed i do think it s fair to note he can rebut it that arkansas is one of the few states that doesn t have any civil rights legislation i ve tried to use the white house as a bully pulpit speaking out against discrimination we passed two very forward looking civil rights bills it s not going to be all done by legislation but i do think that you need to make an appeal every time you can to eliminate racial divisions and discrimination and i ll keep on doing that and pointing to some legislative accomplishment to back it up i have to take 10 seconds here at the end the red light isn t on yet to say to ross perot please don t say to the dea agents on the street that we don t have the will to fight drugs please i have watched these people the same for our local law enforcement people we re backing them in every way we possibly can but maybe you meant that some in the country don t have the will to fight it but those that are out there on the front line as you know you ve been a strong backer of law enforcement really i just want to clear that up have the will to fight it and frankly some of them are giving their lives mr lehrer time mr president all right let s go now to another subject the subject of health the first question for 2 minutes is to president bush and john will ask it aids mr mashek mr president yesterday tens of thousands of people paraded past the white house to demonstrate their concern about the disease aids a celebrated member of your commission magic johnson quit saying that there was too much inaction where is this widespread feeling coming from that your administration is not doing enough about aids president bush coming from the political process we have increased funding for aids we ve doubled it on research and on every other aspect of it my request for this year was 4 9 billion for aids 10 times as much for aids victim as per cancer victim i think that we re showing the proper compassion and concern so i can t tell you where it s coming from but i am very much concerned about aids and i believe that we ve got the best researchers in the world out there at nih working the problem we re funding them i wish there was more money but we re funding them far more than any time in the past we re going to keep on doing that i don t know i was a little disappointed in magic because he came to me and i said now if you see something we re not doing get ahold of me call me let me know he went to one meeting and then we heard that he was stepping down so he s been replaced by mary fisher who electrified the republican convention by talking about the compassion and the concern that we feel it was a beautiful moment and i think she ll do a first class job on that commission so i think the appeal is yes we care the other thing is part of aids it s one of the few diseases where behavior matters and i once called on somebody well change your behavior if the behavior you re using is prone to cause aids change the behavior the next thing i know one of these act up groups is out saying bush ought to change his behavior you can t talk about it rationally the extremes are hurting the aids cause to go into a catholic mass in a beautiful cathedral in new york under the cause of helping in aids and start throwing condoms around in the mass i m sorry i think it sets back the cause we cannot move to the extreme we ve got to care we ve got to continue everything we can at the federal and the local level barbara i think is doing a superb job in destroying the myth about aids all of us are in this fight together all of us care do not go to the extreme mr lehrer one minute mr perot mr perot first i think mary fisher was a great choice we re lucky to have her heading the commission secondly i think one thing that if i were sent to do the job i would sit down with fda look exactly where we are then i would really focus on let s get these things out if you re going to die you don t have to go through this 10 year cycle that fda goes through on new drugs believe me people with aids are more than willing to take that risk we could be moving out to the human population a whole lot faster than we are on some of these new drugs so i think we can expedite the problem there let me go back a minute to racial divisiveness all time low in our country was the judge thomas anita hill hearings and those senators ought to be hanging their heads in shame for what they did there second thing there are not many times in your life when you get to talk to a whole country but let me just say this to all of america if you hate people i don t want your vote that s how strongly i feel about it mr lehrer governor clinton one minute governor clinton over 150 000 americans have died of aids well over a million and a quarter americans are hiv positive we need to put one person in charge of the battle against aids to cut across all the agencies that deal with it we need to accelerate the drug approval process we need to fully fund the act named for that wonderful boy ryan white to make sure we re doing everything we can on research and treatment the president should lead a national effort to change behavior to keep our children alive in the schools responsible behavior to keep people alive this is a matter of life and death i ve worked in my state to reduce teen pregnancy and illness among children and i know it s tough the reason magic johnson resigned from the aids commission is because the statement you heard tonight from mr bush is the longest and best statement he s made about it in public i m proud of what we did at the democratic convention putting two hiv positive people on the platform and i m proud of the leadership that i m going to bring to this country in dealing with the aids crisis mr lehrer new question for mr perot you have 2 minutes to answer and ann will ask it entitlement programs ms compton mr perot even if you ve got what people say are the guts to take on changes in the most popular and the most sacred of the entitlements medicare people say you haven t a prayer of actually getting anything passed in washington since the president isn t a lone ranger how in the world can you make some of those unpopular changes mr perot two ways number one if i get there it will be a very unusual and historical event because laughter because the people not the special interests put me there i will have a unique mandate i have said again and again and this really upsets the establishment in washington that we re going to inform the people in detail on the issues through an electronic town hall so that they really know what s going on they will want to do what s good for our country now all these fellows with thousand dollar suits and alligator shoes running up and down the halls of congress that make policy now the lobbyists the pac guys the foreign lobbyists what have you they ll be over there in the smithsonian laughter because we re going to get rid of them the congress will be listening to the people and the american people are willing to have fair shared sacrifice they re not as stupid as washington thinks they are the american people are bright intelligent caring loving people who want a great country for their children and grandchildren they will make those sacrifices so i welcome that challenge and just watch because if the american people send me there we ll get it done now everybody will faint in washington they ve never seen anything happen in that town this is a town where the white house says congress did it congress says the white house did it and i m sitting there and saying well who else could be around and then when they get off by themselves they said nobody did it and yet the cash register is empty and it used to have our money the taxpayers money in it and we didn t get the results we ll get it done mr lehrer governor one minute governor clinton ross that s a great speech but it s not quite that simple i mean look at the facts both parties in washington the president and the congress have cut medicare the average senior citizen is spending a higher percentage of income on health care today than they were in 1965 before medicare came in the president s got another proposal to require them to pay 400 a year more for the next 5 years but if you don t have the guts to control cost by changing the insurance system and taking on the bureaucracies and the regulation of health care in the private and public sector you can t fix this problem costs will continue to spiral just remember this folks a lot of folks on medicare are out there every day making the choice between food and medicine not poor enough for medicare medicaid not wealthy enough to buy their medicine i ve met them people like mary annie and edward davis of nashua new hampshire all over this country they cannot even buy medicine so let s be careful when we talk about cutting health care costs let s start with the insurance companies and the people that are making a killing instead of making our people healthy mr lehrer one minute president bush president bush well first place i d like to clear up something because every 4 years the democrats go around and say hey republicans are going to cut social security and medicare they ve started it again i am the president that stood up and said don t mess with social security and i m not going to and we haven t we are not going to go after the social security recipient i have one difference with mr perot on that because i don t think we need to touch social security what we do need to do though is control the growth of these mandatory programs and ross properly says okay there s some pain in that but governor clinton refuses to touch that simply refuses so what we ve got to do is control it the growth let it grow for inflation let it grow for the amount of new people added population and then hold the line i believe that is the way you get the deficit down not by the tax and spend program that we hear every 4 years whether it s mondale dukakis whoever else it is i just don t believe we ought to do that so hold the line on social security and put a cap on the growth of the mandatory program mr lehrer new question it is for governor clinton 2 minute answer sandy will ask it health care costs mr vanocur governor clinton ann compton has brought up medicare i remember in 1965 when wilbur mills of arkansas the chairman of ways and means was pushing it through the congress the charge against it was it s socialized medicine one you never governor clinton mr bush made that charge mr vanocur well he served with him 2 years later in 1967 where i first met him the second point though is that it is now skyrocketing out of control people want it we say it s going bonkers is not the oregon plan applied to medicaid rationing the proper way to go even though the federal government last august ruled that violated the americans with disabilities act of 1990 governor clinton i thought the oregon plan should at least have been allowed to be tried because at least the people in oregon were trying to do something let me go back to the main point sandy mr bush is trying to run against lyndon johnson and jimmy carter and everybody in the world but me in this race i have proposed a managed competition plan for health care i will say again you cannot control health care costs simply by cutting medicare look what s happened the federal government has cut medicare and medicaid in the last few years states have cut medicaid we ve done it in arkansas under budget pressures but what happens more and more people get on the rolls as poverty increases if you don t control the health care costs of the entire system you cannot get control of it look at our program we ve set up a national ceiling on health care costs tied to inflation and population growth set by health care providers not by the government we provide for managed competition not government models in every state and we control private and public health care costs now just a few days ago a bipartisan commission of republicans and democrats more republicans than democrats said my plan will save the average family 1 200 a year more than the bush plan will by the year 2000 2 2 trillion in the next 12 years 400 billion a year by the end of this decade i ve got a plan to control health care costs but you can t just do it by cutting medicare you have to take on the insurance companies the bureaucracies and you have to have cost controls yes but keep in mind we are spending 30 percent more on health care than any country in the world any other country yet we have 35 million people uninsured we have no preventive and primary care the oregon plan is a good start if the federal government is going to continue to abandon its responsibilities i say if germany can cover everybody and keep costs under inflation if hawaii can cover 98 percent of their people at lower health care costs than the rest of us if rochester new york can do it with two thirds of the cost of the rest of us america can do it too i m tried of being told we can t i say we can we can do better and we must mr lehrer president bush one minute president bush well i don t have time in 30 seconds or one minute to talk about our health care reform plan the oregon plan made some good sense but it s easy to dismiss the concerns of the disabled as president i have to be sure that those waivers which we re approving all over the place are covered under the law maybe we can work it out but the americans for disabilities act speaking about sound and sensible civil rights legislation was the foremost piece of legislation passed in modern times so we do have something more than a technical problem governor clinton clicked off the things you ve got to take on insurance companies and bureaucracies he failed to take on somebody else the malpractice suit people those that bring these lawsuits against these frivolous trial lawyers lawsuits that are running costs of medical care up by 25 billion to 50 billion he refuses to put anything controls on these crazy lawsuits if you want to help somebody don t run the costs up by making doctors have to have five or six tests where one would do for fear of being sued or have somebody along the highway not stop to pick up a guy and help him because he s afraid a trial lawyer will come along and sue him we re suing each other too much and caring for each other too little mr lehrer mr perot one minute mr perot we ve got the most expensive health care system in the world it ranks behind 15 other nations when we come to life expectancy and 22 other nations when we come to infant mortality so we don t have the best pretty simple folks if you re paying more and you don t have the best if all else fails go copy the people who have the best who spend less right but we can do better than that again we ve got plans lying all over the place in washington nobody ever implements them now i m back to square one if you want to stop talking about it and do it then i ll be glad to go up there and we ll get it done but if you just want to keep the music going just stay traditional this next time around and 4 years from now you ll have everybody blaming everybody else for a bad health care system talk is cheap words are plentiful deeds are precious let s get on with it mr lehrer and that s exactly what we re going to do that was in fact the final question and answer we re now going to move to closing statements each candidate will have up to 2 minutes the order remember was determined by a drawing and mr perot you were first closing statements mr perot well it s been a privilege to be able to talk to the american people tonight i make no bones about it i love this country i love the principle it s founded on i love the people here i don t like to see the country s principles violated i don t like to see the people in a deteriorating economy and a deteriorating country because our government has lost touch with the people the people in washington are good people we just have a bad system we ve got to change the system it s time to do it because we have run up so much debt that time is no longer our friend we ve got to put our house in order when you go to bed tonight look at your children think of their dreams think of your dreams as a child and ask yourself isn t it time to stop talking about it isn t it time to stop creating images isn t it time to do it aren t you sick of being treated like an unprogrammed robot every 4 years they send you all kinds of messages to tell you how to vote and then go back to business as usual they told you at the tax and budget summit that if you agreed to a tax increase we could balance the budget they didn t tell you that that same year they increased spending 1 83 for every dollar we increased taxes that s washington in a nutshell right there in the final analysis i m doing this for your children when you look at them tonight there s another group that i feel very close to and these are the men and women who fought on the battlefield the children the families of the ones who died the people who left parts of their bodies over there i d never ask you to do anything for me but i owe you this and i m doing it for you i can t tell you what it means to me at these rallies when i see you and you come up and the look in your eyes i know how you feel and you know how i feel and then i think of the older people who are retired they grew up in the depression they fought and won world war ii we owe you a debt we can never repay you and the greatest repayment i can ever give is to recreate the american dream for your children and grandchildren i ll give it everything i have if you want me to do it mr lehrer governor clinton your closing statement governor clinton i d like to thank the people of st louis and washington university the presidential debate commission and all those who made this night possible and i d like to thank those of you who are watching most of all i d like to thank all of you who have touched me in some way over this last year all the thousands of you whom i ve seen i d like to thank the computer executives and the electronics executives in silicon valley two thirds of whom are republicans who said they wanted to sign on to a change to create a new america i d like to thank the hundreds of executives who came to chicago a third of them republicans who said they wanted a change i d like to thank the people who started with mr perot who have come on to help our campaign i d like to thank all the folks around america that no one ever knows about the woman who was holding the aids baby she adopted in cedar rapids iowa who asked me to do something more for adoption the woman who stopped along the road in wisconsin and wept because her husband had lost his job after 27 years all the people who are having a tough time and the people who are winning but who know how desperately we need to change this debate tonight has made crystal clear a challenge that is as old as america the choice between hope and fear change or more of the same the courage to move into a new tomorrow or to listen to the crowd who says things could be worse mr bush has said some very compelling things tonight that don t quite square with the record he was president for 3 years before he proposed a health care plan that still hasn t been sent to congress in total 3 years before an economic plan and he still didn t say tonight that that tax bill he vetoed raised taxes only on the rich and gave the rest of you a break but he vetoed it anyway i offer a new direction invest in american jobs american education control health care costs bring this country together again i want the future of this country to be as bright and brilliant as its past and it can be if we have the courage to change mr lehrer president bush your closing statement president bush well let me tell you a little what it s like to be president in the oval office you can t predict what kind of crisis is going to come up you have to make tough calls you can t be on one hand this way and one hand another you can t take different positions on these difficult issues then you need a philosophical i d call it a philosophical underpinning mine for foreign affairs is democracy and freedom look at the dramatic changes around the world the cold war is over the soviet union is no more and we re working with a democratic country poland hungary czechoslovakia the baltics are free take a look at the middle east we had to stand up against a tyrant the united states came together as we haven t in many many years we kicked this man out of kuwait in the process as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the middle east nobody would have dreamed it possible i think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust all this is good on the domestic side what we must do is have change that empowers people not change for the sake of change tax and spend we don t need to do that anymore what we need to do is empower people we need to invest and save we need to do better in education we need to do better in job retraining we need to expand our exports and they re going very very well indeed we need to strengthen the american family i hope as president that i ve earned your trust i ve admitted it when i make a mistake but then i go on and help try to solve the problems i hope i ve earned your trust because a lot of being president is about trust and character and i ask for your support for 4 more years to finish this job thank you very very much mr lehrer don t go away yet i just want to thank the three panelists and thank the three candidates for participating president bush governor clinton and mr perot they will appear again together on october the 15th and again on october 19th next tuesday there will be a debate among the three candidates for vice president and for now from washington university in st louis missouri i m jim lehrer thank you and good night

to the congress of the united states no congress of the united states ever assembled on surveying the state of the union has met with a more pleasing prospect than that which appears at the present time in the domestic field there is tranquility and contentment harmonious relations between management and wage earner freedom from industrial strife and the highest record of years of prosperity in the foreign field there is peace the good will which comes from mutual understanding and the knowledge that the problems which a short time ago appeared so ominous are yielding to the touch of manifest friendship the great wealth created by our enterprise and industry and saved by our economy has had the widest distribution among our own people and has gone out in a steady stream to serve the charity and the business of the world the requirements of existence have passed beyond the standard of necessity into the region of luxury enlarging production is consumed by an increasing demand at hom6 and ail expanding commerce abroad the country can regard the present with satisfaction and anticipate the future with optimism the main source of these unexampled blessings lies in the integrity and character of the american people they have had great faith which they have supplemented with inighty works they have been able to put trust in each other and trust in their government their candor in dealing with foreign governments hag commanded respect and confidence yet these remarkable powers would have been exerted almost in vain without the constant cooperation and careful administration of the federal government we have been coming into a period which may be fairly characterized as a conservation of our national resources wastefulness in public business and private enterprise has been displaced by constructive economy this has been accomplished by bringing our domestic and foreign relations more and more under a reign of law a rule of force has been giving way to a rule of reason we have substituted for the vicious circle of increasing expenditures increasing tax rates and diminishing profits the charmed circle of diminishing expenditures diminishing tax rates and increasing profits four times we have made a drastic revision of our internal revenue system abolishing many taxes and substantially reducing almost all others each time the resulting stimulation to business has so increased taxable incomes and profits that a surplus has been ro duced one third of the national debt has been paid while much of the other two thirds has been refunded at lower rates and these savings of interest and constant economies have enabled us to repeat the satisfying process of more tax reductions under this sound and healthful encouragement the national income has increased nearly 50 per cent until it is estimated to stand well over 90 000 000 000 it gas been a method which has performed the secining miracle of leaving a much greater percentage of earnings in the hands of the taxpayers with scarcely any diminution of the government revenue that is constructive economy in the highest degree it is the corner stone of prosperity it should not fail to be continued this action began by the application of economy to public expenditure if it is to be permanent it must be made so by the repeated application of economy there is no surplus on which to base further tax revision at this time last june the estimates showed a threatened deficit for the current fiscal year of 94 000 000 under my direction the departments began saving all they could out of their present appropriations the last tax reduction brought an encouraging improvement in business beginning early in october which w1 11 also increase our revenue the combination of economy and good times now indicates a surplus of about 37 000 000 this is a margin of less than i percent on out expenditures and makes it obvious that the treasury is in no condition to undertake increases in ditures to be made before june 30 it is necessary therefor stuing the present session to refrain from new appropriations for immediate outlay or if such are absolutely required to provide for them by new revenue otherwise we shall reach the end of the year with the unthinkable result of an unbalanced budget for the first time during my term of office we face that contingency i am certain that the congress would not pass and i should not feel warranted in approving legislation which would involve us in that financial disgrace on the whole the finances of the government are most satisfactory last year the national debt was reduced about 906 000 000 the refunding and retirement of the second and third liberty loans have just been brought to a successful conclusion which will save about 75 000 0w a year in interest the unpaid balance has been arranged in maturities convenient for carrying out our permanent debt paying program the enormous savings made have not been at the expense of any legitimate public need the government plant has been kept up and many improvements are tinder way while its service is fully manned and the general efficiency of operation has increased we have been enabled to undertake many new enterprises among these are the adjusted compensation of the veterans of the world war which is costing us 112 000 000 a year amortizing our liability to the civil service retirement funds 20 000 000 increase of expenditures for rivers and harbors including flood control 43 000 000 public buildings 47 000 000 in 1928 we spent 50 000 000 in the adjustment of war claims and alien property these are examples of a large list of items foreign reiations when we turn from our domestic affairs to our foreign relations we likewise perceive peace and progress the sixth international conference of american states was held at habana last winter it contributed to a better understanding and cooperation among the nations eleven important conventions were signed and 71 resolutions passed pursuant to the plan then adopted this government has invited the other 20 nations of this hemisphere to it conference on conciliation and arbitration which meets in washington on december 10 all the nations have accepted and the expectation is justified that important progress will be made in methods for resolving international differences by means of arbitration during the year we have signed 11 new arbitration treaties and 22 more are tinder negotiation nicaragua when a destructive and bloody revolution lately broke out in nicaragua at the earnest and repeated entreaties of its government i dispatched our marine forces there to protect the lives and interests of our citizens to compose the contending parties i sent there col henry l stimson former secretary of war and now governor general of the philippine islands who secured an agreement that warfare should cease a national election should be held and peace should be restored both parties conscientiously carried out this agreement with the exception of a few bandits who later mostly surrendered or left the country president diaz appointed brig gen frank r mccoy united states army president of the election board which included also one member of each political party a free and fair election has been held and has worked out so successfully that both parties have joined in requesting like cooperation from this country at the election four years hence to which i have refrained from making any commitments although our country must be gratified at such an exhibition of success and appreciation nicaragua is regaining its prosperity and has taken a long step in the direction of peaceful self government tacna arica the long standing differences between chile and peru have been sufficiently composed so that diplomatic relations have been resumed by the exchange of ambassadors negotiations are hopefully proceeding as this is written for the final adjustment of the differences over their disputed territory mexico our relations with mexico are on a more satisfactory basis than at any time since their revolution many misunderstandings have been resolved and the most frank and friendly negotiations promise a final adjustment of all unsettled questions it is exceedingly gratifying that ambassador morrow has been able to bring our two neighboring countries which have so many interests in common to a position of confidence in each other and of respect for mutual sovereign rights china the situation in china which a few months ago was so threatening as to call for the dispatch of a large additional force has been much composed the nationalist government has established itself over the country and promulgated a new organic law announcing a program intended to promote the political and economic welfare of the people we have recognized this government encouraged its progress and have negotiated a treaty restoring to china complete tariff autonomy and guaranteeing our citizens against discriminations our trade in that quarter is increasing and our forces are being reduced greek and austrian debts pending before the congress is a recommendation for the settlement of the greek debt and the austrian debt both of these are comparatively small and our country can afford to be generous the rehabilitation of these countries await their settlement there would also be advantages to our trade we could scarcely afford to be the only nation that refuses the relief which austria seeks the congress has already granted austria a long time moratorium which it is understood will be waived and immediate payments begun on her debt on the same basis which we have extended to other countries peace treaty one of the most important treaties ever laid before the senate of the united states will be that which the 15 nations recently signed at paris and to which 44 other nations have declared their intention to adhere renouncing war as a national policy and agreeing to resort only to peaceful means for the adjustment of international differences it is the most solemn declaration against war the most positive adherence to peace that it is possible for sovereign nations to make it does not supersede our inalienable sovereign right and duty of national defense or undertake to commit us before the event to any mode of action which the congress might decide to be wise it ever the treaty should be broken but it is a new standard in the world around which can rally the informed and enlightened opinion of nations to prevent their governments from beii4 forced into hostile action by the temporary outbreak of international animosities the observance of this covenant so simple and so straightforward promises more for the peace of the world than any other agreement ever negotiated among the nations national defense the first duty of our government to its own citizens and foreigners within its borders is the preservation of order unless and until that duty is met a government is not even eligible for recognition among the family of nations the advancement of world civilization likewise is dependent upon that order among the people of different countries which we term peace to insure our citizens against the infringement of their legal rights at home and abroad to preserve order liberty and peace by making the law supreme we have an army and a navy both of these are organized for defensive purposes our army could not be much reduced but does not need to be increased such new housing and repairs as are necessary are tinder way and the 6 year program in aviation is being put into effect in both branches of our service our navy according to generally accepted standards is deficient in cruisers we have 10 comparatively new vessels 22 that are old and 8 to be built it is evident that renewals and replacements must be provided this matter was thoroughly canvassed at the last session of the congress and does not need restatement the bill before the senate with the elimination of the time clause should be passed we have no intention of competing with any other country this building program is for necessary replacements and to meet our needs for defense the cost of national defense is stupendous it has increased 118 000 000 in the past four years the estimated expenditure for 1930 is 668 000 000 while this is made up of many items it is after all mostly dependent upon numbers our defensive needs do not can for any increase in the number of men in the army or the navy we have reached the limit of what we ought to expend for that purpose i wish to repeat again for the benefit of the timid and the suspicious that this country is neither militaristic nor imperialistic many people at home and abroad who constantly make this charge are the same ones who are even more solicitous to have us extend assistance to foreign countries when such assistance is granted the inevitable result is that we have foreign interests for us to refuse the customary support and protection of such interests would be in derogation of the sovereignty of this nation our largest foreign interests are in the british empire france and italy because we are constantly solicitous for those interests i doubt if anyone would suppose that those countries feel we harbor toward them any militaristic or imperialistic design as for smaller countries we cer tainly do not want any of them we are more anxious than they are to have their sovereignty respected our entire influence is in behalf of their independence cuba stands as a witness to our adherence to this principle the position of this government relative to the limitation of armaments the results already secured and the developments up to the present time are so well known to the congress that they do not require any restatement veterans the magnitude of our present system of veterans relief is without precedent and the results have been far reaching for years a service pension has been granted to the grand army and lately to the survivors of the spanish american war at the time we entered the world war however congress departed from the usual pension system followed by our gove2rnment eleven years have elapsed since our laws were first enacted initiating a system of compensation rehabilitation hospitalization and insurance for the disabled of the world war and their dependents the administration of all the laws concerning relief has been a difficult task but it can safely be stated that these measures have omitted nothing in their desire to deal generously and humanely we should continue to foster this system and provide all the facilities necessary for adequate care it is the conception of our government that the pension roll is an honor roll it should include all those who are justly entitled to its benefits but exclude all others annual expenditures for all forms of veterans relief now approximate 765 000 000 and are increasing from year to year it is doubtful if the peak of expenditures will be reached even under present legislation for sonic time yet to come further amendments to the existing law will be suggested by the american legion the veterans of foreign wars of the united states the disabled american veterans of the world war and other like organizations and it may be necessary for administrative purposes or in order to remove some existing inequalities in the present law to make further changes i am sure that such recommendations its may be submitted to the congress will receive your careful consideration but because of the vast expenditure now being made each year with every assurance that it will increase and because of the great liberality of the existing law the proposal of any additional legislation dealing with this subject should receive most searching scrutiny from the congress you are familiar with the suggestion that the various public agencies now dealing with matters of veterans relief be consolidated in one government department some advantages to this plan seem apparent especially in the simplification of administration find in the opportunity of bringing about a greater uniformity in the application of veterans relief i recommend that a survey be made by the proper committees of congress dealing with this subject in order to determine whether legislation to secure this consolidation is desirable agriculture the past year has been marked by notable though not uniform improvement in agriculture the general purchasing power of farm products and the volume of production have advanced this means not only further progress in overcoming the price disparity into which agriculture was plunged in 1920 21 but also increased efficiency on the part of farmers and a well grounded confidence in the future of agriculture the livestock industry has attained the best balance for many years and is prospering conspicuously dairymen beef producers an poultrymen are receiving substantially larger returns than last year cotton although lower in price than at this time last year was produced in greater volume and the prospect for cotton incomes is favorable but progress is never uniform in a vast and highly diversified agriculture or industry cash grains hay tobacco and potatoes will bring somewhat smaller returns this year than last present indications are however that the gross farm income will be somewhat larger than in the crop year 1927 28 when the total was 12 253 000 000 the corresponding figure for 1926 27 was 12 127 000 000 and in 1925 26 12 670 000 000 still better results would have been secured this year had there not been an undue increase in the production of certain crops this is particularly true of potatoes which have sold at an unremunerative price or at a loss as a direct result of overexpansion of acreage the present status of agriculture although greatly improved over that of a few years ago bespeaks the need of further improvemen4 which calls for determined effort of farmers themselves encouraged and assisted by wise public policy the government has been and must continue to be alive to the needs of agriculture in the past eight years more constructive legislation of direct benefit to agriculture has been adopted than during any other period the department of agriculture has been broadened and reorganized to insure greater efficiency the department is laying greater stress on the economic and business phases of agriculture it is lending every possible assistance to cooperative marketing associations regulatory and research work have been segregated in order that each field may be served more effectively i can not too strongly commend in the field of fact finding the research work of the department of agriculture and the state experiment stations the department now receives annually 4 000 000 more for research than in 1921 in addition the funds paid to the states for experimentation purposes under the purnell act constitute an annual increase in federal payments to state agricultural experiment stations of 2 400 000 over the amount appropriated in 1921 the program of support for research may wisely be continued and expanded since 1921 we have appropriated nearly an additional 2 000 000 for extension work and this sum is to be increased next year under authorization by the capper ketcham act the surplus problem while these developments in fundamental research regulation and dissemination of agricultural information are of distinct hell to agriculture additional effort is needed the surplus problem demands attention as emphasized in my last message the government should assume no responsibility in normal times for crop surplus clearly due to overextended acreage the government should however provide reliable information as a guide to private effort and in this connection fundamental research on prospective supply and demand as a guide to production and marketing should be encouraged expenditure of public funds to bring in more new land should have most searching scrutiny so long as our farmers face unsatisfactory prices for crops and livestock produced on land already under cultivation every proper effort should be made to put land to uses for which it is adapted the reforestation of land best suited for timber production is progressing and should be encouraged and to this end the forest taxation inquiry was instituted to afford a practical guide for public policy improvement bas been made in grazing regulation in the forest reserves not only to protect the ranges but to preserve the soil from erosion similar action is urgently needed to protect other public lands which are now overgrazed and rapidly eroding temporary expedients though sometimes capable of appeasing the demands of the moment can not permanently solve the surplus problem and might seriously aggravate it hence putting the government directly into business subsidies and price fixing and the alluring promises of political action as a substitute for private initiative should be avoided the government should aid in promoting orderly marketing and in handling surpluses clearly due to weather and seasonal conditions as a beginning there should be created a federal farm board consisting of able and experienced men empowered to advise producers associations in establishing central agencies or stabilization corporations to handle surpluses to seek wore economical means of merchandising and to aid the producer in securing returns according to the a14 of his product a revolving loan fund should be provided for the necessary financing until these agencies shall have developed means of financing their operations through regularly constituted credit institutions such a bill should carry authority for raising the money by loans or otherwise necessary to meet the expense as the treasury has no surplus agriculture has lagged behind industry in achieving that unity of effort which modern economic life demands the cooperative movement which is gradually building the needed organization is in harmony with public interest and therefore merits public encouragement the responsibility of the states important phases of public policy related to agriculture lie within the sphere of the states while successive reductions in federal taxes have relieved most farmers of direct taxes to the national government state and local levies have become a serious burden this problem needs immediate and thorough study with a view to correction at the earliest possible moment it will have to be made largely by the states themselves commerce it is desirable that the government continue its helpful attitude toward american business the activities of the department of commerce have contributed largely to the present satisfactory posi tion in our international trade which has reached about 9 000 000 000 annually there should be no slackening of effort in that direction it is also important that the department s assistance to domestic commerce be continued there is probably no way in which the government can aid sound economic progress more effectively than by cooperation with our business men to reduce wastes in distribution commercial aeronautics continued progress in civil aviation is most gratifying demands for airplanes and motors have taxed both the industry and the licensing and inspection service of the department of commerce to their capacity while the compulsory licensing provisions of the air commerce act apply only to equipment and personnel engaged in interstate and foreign commerce a federal license may be procured by anyone possessing the necessary qualifications state legislation local airport regulations and insurance requirements make such a license practically indispensable this results in uniformity of regulation and increased safety in operation which are essential to aeronautical development over 17 000 young men and women have now applied for federal air pilot s licenses or permits more than 80 per cent of them applied during the past year our national airway system exceeds 14 000 miles in length and has 7 500 miles lighted for night operations provision has been made for lighting 4 000 miles more during the current fiscal year and equipping an equal mileage with radio facilities three quarters of our people are now served by these routes with the rapid growth of air mail express and passenger service this new transportation medium is daily becoming a more important factor in commerce it is noteworthy that this development has taken place without governmental subsidies commercial passenger flights operating on schedule have reached 13 000 miles per day during the next fortnight this nation will entertain the nations of the world in a celebration of the twenty fifth anniversary of the first successful airplane flight the credit for this epoch making achievement belongs to a citizen of our own country orville wright cuban parcel post i desire to repeat my recommendation of an earlier message that congress enact the legislation necessary to make permanent the parcel post convention with cuba both as a facility to american commerce and as a measure of equity to cuba in the one class of goods which that country can send here by parcel post without detriment to our own trade maine battleship memorial when i attended the pan american conference at habana the president of cuba showed me a marble statue made from the original memorial that was overturned by a storm after it was erected on the cuban shore to the memory of the men who perished in the destruction of the battleship maine as a testimony of friendship and appreciation of the cuban government and people lie most gen erously offered to present this to the united states and i assured him of my pleasure in accepting it there is no location in the white house for placing so large and heavy a structure and i therefore urge the congress to provide by law for some locality where it can be set up railroads in previous annual messages i have suggested the enactment of laws to promote railroad consolidation with the view of increasing the efficiency of transportation and lessening its cost to the public while consolidations can and should be made under the present law until it is changed vet the provisions of the act of 1920 have not been found fully adequate to meet the needs of other methods of consolidation amendments designed to remedy these defects have been considered at length by the respective committees of congress and a bill was reported out late in the last session which i understand has the approval in principle of the interstate commerce commission it is to be hoped that this legislation may be enacted at an early date experience has shown that the interstate commerce law requires definition and clarification in several other respects some of which have been pointed out by the interstate commerce commission in its annual reports to the congress it will promote the public interest to have the congress give early consideration to the recommendations there made merchant marine the cost of maintaining the united states government merchant fleet has been steadily reduced we have established american flag lines in foreign trade where they had never before existed as a means of promoting commerce and as a naval auxiliary there have been sold to private american capital for operation within the past few years 14 of these lines which under the encouragement of the recent legislation passed by the congress give promise of continued successful operation additional legislation from time to time may be necessary to promote future advancement under private control through the cooperation of the post office department and the shipping board long term contracts are being made with american steamship lines for carrying mail which already promise the construction of 15 to 20 new vessels and the gradual reestablishment of the american merchant marine as a private enterprise no action of the national government has been so beneficial to our shipping the cost is being absorbed to a considerable extent by the disposal of unprofitable lines operated by the shipping board for which the new law has made a market meanwhile it should be our policy to maintain necessary strategic lines under the government operation until they can be transferred to private capital inter american highway in my message last year i expressed the view that we should lend our encouragement for more good roads to all the principal points on this hemisphere south of the rio grande my view has not changed the pan american union has recently indorsed it in some of the countries to the south a great deal of progress is being made in road building in others engineering features are often exacting and financing difficult as those countries enter upon programs for road building we should be ready to contribute from our abundant experience to make their task easier of accomplishment i prefer not to go into civil life to accomplish this end we already furnish military and naval advisors and following this precedent we could draw competent men from these same sources and from the department of agriculture we should provide our southern neighbors if they request it with such engineer advisors for the construction of roads and bridges private t1literests should look with favor upon all reasonable loans sought by these countries to open main lines of travel such assistance should be given especially to any project for a highway designed to connect all the countries on this hemisphere and thus facilitate intercourse and closer relations among them air mail service the friendly relations and the extensive commercial intercourse with the western hemisphere to the south of us are being further cemented by the establishment and extension of air mail routes we shall soon have one from key west fla over cuba haiti and santo domingo to san juan p r where it will connect with another route to trinidad there will be another route from key west to the canal zone where connection will be made with a route across the northern coast of south america to paramaribo this will give us a circle around the caribbean under our own control additional connections will be made at colon with a route running down the west coast of south america as far as conception chile and with the french air mail at paramaribo running down the eastern coast of south america the air service already spans our continent with laterals running to mexico and canada and covering a daily flight of over 28 000 miles with an average cargo of 15 000 pounds waterways our river and harbor improvements are proceeding with vigor in the past few years ave have increased the appropriation for this regular work 28 000 000 besides what is to be expended on flood control the total appropriation for this year was over 91 000 000 the ohio river is almost ready for opening work on the missouri and other rivers is under way in accordance with the mississippi flood law army engineers are making investigations and surveys on other streams throughout the country with a view to flood control navigation waterpower and irrigation our bar re lines are being operated under generous appropriations and negotiations are developing relative to the st lawrence waterway to secure the largest benefits from all these waterways joint rates must be established with the railroads preferably by agreement but otherwise as a result of congressional action we have recently passed several river and harbor bills the work ordered by the congress not yet completed will cost about 243 000 000 besides the hundreds of millions to be spent on the mississippi flood way until we can see our way out of this expense no further river and harbor legislation should be passed as expenditures to put it into effect would be four or five years away irrigation of arid lands for many years the federal government has been committed to the wise policy of reclamation and irrigation while it has met with some failures due to unwise selection of projects and lack of thorough soil surveys so that they could not be placed on a sound business basis on the whole the service has been of such incalculable benefit in so many states that no one would advocate its abandonment the program to which we are already committed providing for the construction of new projects authorized by congress and the completion of old projects will tax the resources of the reclamation fund over a period of years the high cost of improving and equipping farms adds to the difficulty of securing settlers for vacant farms on federal projects readjustments authorized by the reclamation relief act of may 25 1926 have given more favorable terms of repayment to settlers these new financial arrangements and the general prosperity on irrigation projects have resulted in increased collections by the department of the interior of charges due the reclamation fund nevertheless the demand for still smaller yearly payments on some projects continues these conditions should have consideration in connection with any proposed new projects colorado river for several years the congress has considered the erection of a dam on the colorado river for flood control irrigation and domestic water purposes all of which ma properly be considered as government functions there would be an incidental creation of water power which could be used for generating electricity as private enterprise can very well fill this field there is no need for the government to go into it it is unfortunate that the states interested in this water have been unable to agree among themselves nevertheless any legislation should give every possible safeguard to the present and prospective rights of each of them the congress will have before it the detailed report of a special board appointed to consider the engineering and economic feasibility of this project from the short summary which i have seen of it 11 judge they consider the engineering problems can be met at somewhat increased cost over previous estimates they prefer the black canyon site on the economic features they are not so clear and appear to base their conclusions on many conditions which can not be established with certainty so far as i can judge however from the summary their conclusions appear sufficiently favorable so that i feel warranted in recommending a measure which will protect the rights of the states discharge the necessary government functions and leave the electrical field to private enterprise muscle shoals the development of other methods of producing nitrates will probably render this plant less important for that purpose than formerly but we have it and i am told it still provides a practical method of making nitrates for national defense and farm fertilizers by dividing the property into its two component parts of power and nitrate plants it would be possible to dispose of the power reserving the right to any concern that wished to make nitrates to use any power that might be needed for that purpose such a disposition of the power plant can be made that will return in rental about 2 000 000 per year if the congress would giant the secretary of war authority to lease the nitrate plant on such terms as would insure the largest production of nitrates the entire property could begin to function such a division i am aware has never seemed to appeal to the congress i should also gladly approve a bill granting authority to lease the entire property for the production of nitrates i wish to avoid building another lam at public expense future operators should provide for that themselves but if they were to be required to repay the cost of such dam with tile prevailing commercial rates for interest this difficulty will be considerably lessened nor do i think this property should be made a vehicle for putting the united states government indiscriminately into the private and retail field of power distribution and nitrate sales conservation the practical application of economy to the resources of the country calls for conservation this does not mean that every resource should not be developed to its full degree but it means that none of them should be wasted we have a conservation board working on our oil problem this is of the utmost importance to the future well being of our people in this age of oil burning engines and tile general application of gasoline to transportation the secretary of the interior should not be compelled to lease oil lands of the osage indians when the market is depressed and the future supply is in jeopardy while the area of lands remaining in public ownership is small compared with the vast area in private ownership the natural resources of those in public ownership are of immense present and future value this is particularly trite as to minerals and water power the proper bureaus have been classifying these resources to the end that they may be conserved appropriate estimates are being submitted in the budget for the further prosecution of this important work immigration the policy of restrictive immigration should be maintained authority should be granted the secretary of labor to give immediate preference to learned professions and experts essential to new industries the reuniting of families should be expedited our immigration and naturalization laws might well be codified wage earner in its economic life our country has rejected the long accepted law of a limitation of the wage fund which led to pessimism and despair because it was the doctrine of perpetual poverty and has substituted for it the american conception that the only limit to profits and wages is production which is the doctrine of optimism and hope because it leads to prosperity here and there the councils of labor are still darkened by the theory that only by limiting individual production can there be any assurance of permanent employment for increasing numbers but in general management and wage earner alike have become emancipated from this doom and have entered a new era in industrial thought which has unleashed the productive capacity of the individual worker with an increasing scale of wages and profits the end of which is not yet the application of this theory accounts for our widening distribution of wealth no discovery ever did more to increase the happiness and prosperity of the people since 1922 increasing production has increased wages in general 12 9 per cent while in certain selected trades they have run as high as 34 9 per cent and 38 per cent even in the boot and shoe shops the increase is over 5 per cent and in woolen mills 8 4 per cent although these industries have not prospered like others as the rise in living costs in this period is negligible these figures represent real wage increases the cause of constructive economy requires that the government should cooperate with private interests to eliminate the waste arising from industrial accidents this item with all that has been done to reduce it still reaches enormous proportions with great suffering to the workman and great loss to the country women and children the federal government should continue its solicitous care for the 8 500 000 women wage earners and its efforts in behalf of public health which is reducing infant mortality and improving the 91odily and mental condition of our citizens civil service the most marked change made in the civil service of the government in the past eight years relates to the increase in salaries the board of actuaries on the retirement act shows by its report that july 1 1921 the average salary of the 330 047 employees subject to the act was j1 307 while on june 30 1927 the average salary of the corresponding 405 263 was 1 969 this was an increase in six years of nearly 53 per cent on top of this was the generous increase made at the last session of the congress generally applicable to federal employees and another bill increasing the pay in certain branches of the postal service beyond the large increase which was made three years ago this raised the average level from 1 969 to 2 092 making an increase in seven years of over 63 per cent while it is well known that in the upper brackets the pay in the federal service is much smaller than in private employment in the lower brackets ranging well up over 3 000 it is much higher it is higher not only in actual money paid but in privileges granted a vacation of 30 actual working days or 5 weeks each year with additional time running in some departments as high as 30 days for sick leave and the generous provisions of the retirement act no other body of public servants ever occupied such a fortunate position education through the bureau of education of the department of the interior the federal government acting in an informative and advisory capacity has rendered valuable service while this province be7crigspeculiarly to the states yet the promotion of education and efficiency in educational methods is a general responsibility of the federal government a survey of negro colleges and universities in the united states has just been completed l7y the bureau of education through funds provided by the institutions themselves and through private sources the present status of negro higher education was determined and recommendations were made for its advancement this was one of the numerous cooperative undertakings of the bureau following the invitation of the association of land grant colleges and universities he bureau of education now has under way the survey of agricultural colleges authorized by congress the purpose of the survey is to ascertain the accomplishments the status and the future objectives of this type of educational training it is now proposed to undertake a survey of secondary schools which educators insist is timely and essential public buildings we have laid out a public building program for the district of columbia and the country at large runni110 into hundreds of millions of dollars three important structures and one annex are already under way and one addition has been completed in the city of washington in the country sites have been acquired many buildings are in course of construction and some are already completed plans for all this work are being prepared in order that it may be carried forward as rapidly as possible this is the greatest building program ever assumed by this nation it contemplates structures of utility and of beauty when it reaches completion the people will be well served and the federal city will be supplied with the most beautiful and stately public buildings which adorn any capital in the world the american indian the administration of indian affairs has been receiving intensive study for several years the department of the interior has been able to provide better supervision of health education and industrial advancement of this native race through additional funds provided by the congress the present cooperative arrangement existing between the bureau of indian affairs and the public health service should be extended the government s responsibility to the american indian has been acknowledged by annual increases in appropria l tions to fulfill its obligations to them and to hasten the time when federal supervision of their affairs may be properly and safely terminated the movement in congress and in some of the state legislatures for extending responsibility in indian affairs to states should be encouraged a complete participation by the indian in our economic life is the end to be desired the negro for 65 years now our negro population has been under the peculiar care and solicitude of the national government the progress which they have made in education and the professions in wealth and in the arts of civilization affords one of the most remarkable incidents in this period of world history they have demonstrated their ability to partake of the advantages of our institutions and to benefit by a free and more and more independent existence whatever doubt there may have been of their capacity to assume the status granted to them by the constitution of this union is being rapidly dissipated their cooperation in the life of the nation is constantly enlarging exploiting the negro problem for political ends is being abandoned and their protection is being increased by those states in which their percentage of population is largest every encouragement should be extended for t le development of the race the colored people have been the victims of the crime of lynching which has in late years somewhat decreased some parts of the south already have wholesome laws for its restraint and punishment their example might well be followed by other states and by such immediate remedial legislation as the federal government can extend under the constitution philippine islands under the guidance of governor general stimson the economic and political conditions of the philippine islands have been raised to a standard never before surpassed the cooperation between his administration and the people of the islands is complete and harmonious it would be an advantage if relief from double taxation could be granted by the congress to our citizens doing business in the islands porto rico due to the terrific storm that swept porto rico last september the people of that island suffered large losses the red cross and the war department went to their rescue the property loss is being retrieved sugar tobacco citrus fruit and coffee all suffered damage the first three can largely look after themselves the coffee growers will need some assistance which should be extended strictly on a business basis and only after most careful investigation the people of porto rico are not asking for charity department of justice it is desirable that all the legal activities of the government be consolidated under the supervision of the attorney general in 1870 it was felt necessary to create the department of justice for this purpose during the intervening period either through legislation creating law officers or departmental action additional legal positions not under the supervision of the attorney general have been provided until there are now over 900 such a condition is as harmful to the interest of the government now as it was in 1870 and should be corrected by appropriate legislation special government counsel in order to prosecute the oil cases i suggested and the congress enacted a law providing for the appointment of two special counsel they have pursued their work with signal ability recovering all the leased lands besides nearly 30 000 000 in money and nearly 17 000 000 in other property they find themselves hampered by a statute which the attorney general construes as applying to them prohibiting their appearing for private clients before any department for this reason one has been compelled to resign no good result is secured by the application of this rule to these counsel and as mr roberts has consented to take reappointment if the rule is abrogated i recommend the passage of an amendment to the law creating their office exempting them from the general rule against taking other cases involving the government prohibition the country has duly adopted the eighteenth amendment those who object to it have the right to advocate its modification or repeal meantime it is binding upon the national and state governments and all our inhabitants the federal enforcement bureau is making every effort to prevent violations especially through smuggling manufacture and transportation and to prosecute generally all violations for which it can secure evidence it is bound to continue this policy under the terms of the constitution however the obligation is equally on the states to exercise the power which they have through the executive legislative judicial and police branches of their governments in behalf of enforcement the federal government is doing and will continue to do all it can in this direction and is entitled to7the active cooperation of the states conclusion the country is in the midst of an era of prosperity more extensive and of peace more permanent than it has ever before experienced but having reached this position we should not fail to comprehend that it can easily be lost it needs more effort for its support than the less exalted places of the world we shall not be permitted to take our case but shall continue to be required to spend our days in unremitting toil the actions of the government must command the confidence of the country without this our prosperity would be lost we must extend to other countries the largest measure of generosity moderation and patience in addition to dealing justly we can well afford to walk humbly the end of government is to keep open the opportunity for a more abundant life peace and prosperity are not finalities they are only methods it is too easy under their influence for a nation to become selfish and degenerate this test has come to the united states our country has been provided with the resources with which it can enlarge its intellectual moral and spiritual life the issue is in the hands of the people our faith in man and god is the justification for the belief in our continuing success

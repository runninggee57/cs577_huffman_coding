of dramatic transformation and you have risen to every new challenge you have made our social fabric stronger our families healthier and safer our people more prosperous you the american people have made our passage into the global information age an era of great american renewal in all the work i have done as president every decision i have made every executive action i have taken every bill i

more prosperous world i have steered my course by our enduring values opportunity for all responsibility from all a community of all americans i have sought to give america a new kind of government

of our precious land has been preserved in the continental united states than at any time in a 100 years america has been a force for peace and prosperity in every corner of the globe i m very grateful to be able to turn over the reins of leadership to a new president with america in such a strong position to meet the challenges of the future tonight i want to leave you with three thoughts about our future first america must maintain our record of fiscal responsibility through our last four budgets we ve turned record deficits to record surpluses and we ve been able to pay down 600 billion of our national debt on track to be debt free by the end of the decade for the first time since 1835 staying on that course will bring lower interest rates greater prosperity and the opportunity to meet our big challenges if we choose wisely we can pay down the debt deal with the retirement of the baby boomers invest more in our future and provide tax relief second because the world is more connected every day in every way america s security and prosperity require us to continue to lead in the world at this remarkable moment in history more people live in freedom than ever before our alliances are stronger than ever people all around the world look to america to be a force for peace and prosperity freedom and security the global economy is giving more of our own people and billions around the world the chance to work and live and raise their families with dignity but the forces of integration that have created these good opportunities also make us more subject to global forces of destruction to terrorism organized crime and narcotrafficking the spread of deadly weapons and disease the degradation of the global environment the expansion of trade hasn t fully closed the gap between those of us who live on the cutting edge of the global economy and the billions around the world who live on the knife s edge of survival this global gap requires more than compassion it requires action global poverty is a powder keg that could be ignited by our indifference in his first inaugural address thomas jefferson warned of entangling alliances but in our times america cannot and must not disentangle itself from the world if we want the world to embody our shared values then we must assume a shared responsibility if the wars of the 20th century especially the recent ones in kosovo and bosnia have taught us anything it is that we achieve our aims by defending our values and leading the forces of freedom and peace we must embrace boldly and resolutely that duty to lead to stand with our allies in word and deed and to put a human face on the global economy so that expanded trade benefits all peoples in all nations lifting lives and hopes all across the world third we must remember that america cannot lead in the world unless here at home we weave the threads of our coat of many colors into the fabric of one america as we become ever more diverse we must work harder to unite around our common values and our common humanity we must work harder to overcome our differences in our hearts and in our laws we must treat all our people with fairness and dignity regardless of their race religion gender or sexual orientation and regardless of when they arrived in our country always moving toward the more perfect union of our founders dreams hillary chelsea and i join all americans in wishing our very best to the next president george w bush to his family and his administration in meeting these challenges and in leading freedom s march in this new century as for me i ll leave the presidency more idealistic more full of hope than the day i arrived and more confident than ever that america s best days lie ahead my days in this office are nearly through but my days of service i hope are not in the years ahead i will never hold a position higher or a covenant more sacred than that of president of the united states but there is no title i will wear more proudly than that of citizens thank you god bless you and god bless america

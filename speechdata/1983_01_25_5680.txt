mr speaker mr president distinguished members of the congress honored guests and fellow citizens this solemn occasion marks the 196th time that a president of the united states has reported on the state of the union since george washington first did so in 1790 that s a lot of reports but there s no shortage of new things to say about the state of the union the very key to our success has been our ability foremost among nations to preserve our lasting values by making change work for us rather than against us i would like to talk with you this evening about what we can do together not as republicans and democrats but as americans to make tomorrow s america happy and prosperous at home strong and respected abroad and at peace in the world as we gather here tonight the state of our union is strong but our economy is troubled for too many of our fellow citizens farmers steel and auto workers lumbermen black teenagers working mothers this is a painful period we must all do everything in our power to bring their ordeal to an end it has fallen to us in our time to undo damage that was a long time in the making and to begin the hard but necessary task of building a better future for ourselves and our children we have a long way to go but thanks to the courage patience and strength of our people america is on the mend but let me give you just one important reason why i believe this it involves many members of this body just 10 days ago after months of debate and deadlock the bipartisan commission on social security accomplished the seemingly impossible social security as some of us had warned for so long faced disaster i myself have been talking about this problem for almost 30 years as 1983 began the system stood on the brink of bankruptcy a double victim of our economic ills first a decade of rampant inflation drained its reserves as we tried to protect beneficiaries from the spiraling cost of living then the recession and the sudden end of inflation withered the expanding wage base and increasing revenues the system needs to support the 36 million americans who depend on it when the speaker of the house the senate majority leader and i performed the bipartisan or formed the bipartisan commission on social security pundits and experts predicted that party divisions and conflicting interests would prevent the commission from agreeing on a plan to save social security well sometimes even here in washington the cynics are wrong through compromise and cooperation the members of the commission overcame their differences and achieved a fair workable plan they proved that when it comes to the national welfare americans can still pull together for the common good tonight i m especially pleased to join with the speaker and the senate majority leader in urging the congress to enact this plan by easter there are elements in it of course that none of us prefers but taken together it performs a package that all of us can support it asks for some sacrifice by all the self employed beneficiaries workers government employees and the better off among the retired but it imposes an undue burden on none and in supporting it we keep an important pledge to the american people the integrity of the social security system will be preserved and no one s payments will be reduced the commission s plan will do the job indeed it must do the job we owe it to today s older americans and today s younger workers so before we go any further i ask you to join with me in saluting the members of the commission who are here tonight and senate majority leader howard baker and speaker tip o neill for a job well done i hope and pray the bipartisan spirit that guided you in this endeavor will inspire all of us as we face the challenges of the year ahead nearly half a century ago in this chamber another american president franklin delano roosevelt in his second state of the union message urged america to look to the future to meet the challenge of change and the need for leadership that looks forward not backward throughout the world he said change is the order of the day in every nation economic problems long in the making have brought crises to of many kinds for which the masters of old practice and theory were unprepared he also reminded us that the future lies with those wise political leaders who realize that the great public is interested more in government than in politics so let us in these next two years men and women of both parties every political shade concentrate on the long range bipartisan responsibilities of government not the short range or short term temptations of partisan politics the problems we inherited were far worse than most inside and out of government had expected the recession was deeper than most inside and out of government had predicted curing those problems has taken more time and a higher toll than any of us wanted unemployment is far too high projected federal spending if government refuses to tighten its own belt will also be far too high and could weaken and shorten the economic recovery now underway this recovery will bring with it a revival of economic confidence and spending for consumer items and capital goods the stimulus we need to restart our stalled economic engines the american people have already stepped up their rate of saving assuring that the funds needed to modernize our factories and improve our technology will once again flow to business and industry the inflationary expectations that led to a 21 1 2 percent interest prime rate and soaring mortgage rates 2 years ago are now reduced by almost half leaders have started to realize that double digit inflation is no longer a way of life i misspoke there i should have said lenders so interest rates have tumbled paving the way for recovery in vital industries like housing and autos the early evidence of that recovery has started coming in housing starts for the fourth quarter of 1982 were up 45 percent from a year ago and housing permits a sure indicator of future growth were up a whopping 60 percent we re witnessing an upsurge of productivity and impressive evidence that american industry will once again become competitive in markets at home and abroad ensuring more jobs and better incomes for the nation s work force but our confidence must also be tempered by realism and patience quick fixes and artificial stimulants repeatedly applied over decades are what brought us the inflationary disorders that we ve now paid such a heavy price to cure the permanent recovery in employment production and investment we seek won t come in a sharp short spurt it ll build carefully and steadily in the months and years ahead in the meantime the challenge of government is to identify the things that we can do now to ease the massive economic transition for the american people the federal budget is both a symptom and a cause of our economic problems unless we reduce the dangerous growth rate in government spending we could face the prospect of sluggish economic growth into the indefinite future failure to cope with this problem now could mean as much as a trillion dollars more in national debt in the next four years alone that would average 4 300 in additional debt for every man woman child and baby in our nation to assure a sustained recovery we must continue getting runaway spending under control to bring those deficits down if we don t the recovery will be too short unemployment will remain too high and we will leave an unconscionable burden of national debt for our children that we must not do let s be clear about where the deficit problem comes from contrary to the drumbeat we ve been hearing for the last few months the deficits we face are not rooted in defense spending taken as a percentage of the gross national product our defense spending happens to be only about four fifths of what it was in 1970 nor is the deficit as some would have it rooted in tax cuts even with our tax cuts taxes as a fraction of gross national product remain about the same as they were in 1970 the fact is our deficits come from the uncontrolled growth of the budget for domestic spending during the 1970 s the share of our national income devoted to this domestic spending increased by more than 60 percent from 10 cents out of every dollar produced by the american people to 16 cents in spite of all our economies and efficiencies and without adding any new programs basic necessary domestic spending provided for in this year s budget will grow to almost a trillion dollars over the next 5 years the deficit problem is a clear and present danger to the basic health of our republic we need a plan to overcome this danger a plan based on these principles it must be bipartisan conquering the deficits and putting the government s house in order will require the best effort of all of us it must be fair just as all will share in the benefits that will come from recovery all would share fairly in the burden of transition it must be prudent the strength of our national defense must be restored so that we can pursue prosperity and peace and freedom while maintaining our commitment to the truly needy and finally it must be realistic we can t rely on hope alone with these guiding principles in mind let me outline a four part plan to increase economic growth and reduce deficits first in my budget message i will recommend a federal spending freeze i know this is strong medicine but so far we have only cut the rate of increase in federal spending the government has continued to spend more money each year though not as much more as it did in the past taken as a whole the budget i m proposing for the fiscal year will increase no more than the rate of inflation in other words the federal government will hold the line on real spending now that s far less than many american families have had to do in these difficult times i will request that the proposed 6 month freeze in cost of living adjustments recommended by the bipartisan social security commission be applied to other government related retirement programs i will also propose a 1 year freeze on a broad range of domestic spending programs and for federal civilian and military pay and pension programs and let me say right here i m sorry with regard to the military in asking that of them because for so many years they have been so far behind and so low in reward for what the men and women in uniform are doing but i m sure they will understand that this must be across the board and fair second i will ask the congress to adopt specific measures to control the growth of the so called uncontrollable spending programs these are the automatic spending programs such as food stamps that cannot be simply frozen and that have grown by over 400 percent since 1970 they are the largest single cause of the built in or structural deficit problem our standard here will be fairness ensuring that the taxpayers hard earned dollars go only to the truly needy that none of them are turned away but that fraud and waste are stamped out and i m sorry to say there s a lot of it out there in the food stamp program alone last year we identified almost 1 1 billion in overpayments the taxpayers aren t the only victims of this kind of abuse the truly needy suffer as funds intended for them are taken not by the needy but by the greedy for everyone s sake we must put an end to such waste and corruption third i will adjust our program to restore america s defenses by proposing 55 billion in defense savings over the next 5 years these are savings recommended to me by the secretary of defense who has assured me they can be safely achieved and will not diminish our ability to negotiate arms reductions or endanger america s security we will not gamble with our national survival and fourth because we must ensure reduction and eventual elimination of deficits over the next several years i will propose a standby tax limited to no more than 1 percent of the gross national product to start in fiscal 1986 it would last no more than 3 years and it would start only if the congress has first approved our spending freeze and budget control program and there are several other conditions also that must be met all of them in order for this program to be triggered now you could say that this is an insurance policy for the future a remedy that will be at hand if needed but only resorted to if absolutely necessary in the meantime we ll continue to study ways to simplify the tax code and make it more fair for all americans this is a goal that every american who s ever struggled with a tax form can understand at the same time however i will oppose any efforts to undo the basic tax reforms that we ve already enacted including the 10 percent tax break coming to taxpayers this july and the tax indexing which will protect all americans from inflationary bracket creep in the years ahead now i realize that this four part plan is easier to describe than it will be to enact but the looming deficits that hang over us and over america s future must be reduced the path i ve outlined is fair balanced and realistic if enacted it will ensure a steady decline in deficits aiming toward a balanced budget by the end of the decade it s the only path that will lead to a strong sustained recovery let us follow that path together no domestic challenge is more crucial than providing stable permanent jobs for all americans who want to work the recovery program will provide jobs for most but others will need special help and training for new skills shortly i will submit to the congress the employment act of 1983 designed to get at the special problems of the long term unemployed as well as young people trying to enter the job market i ll propose extending unemployment benefits including special incentives to employers who hire the long term unemployed providing programs for displaced workers and helping federally funded and state administered unemployment insurance programs provide workers with training and relocation assistance finally our proposal will include new incentives for summer youth employment to help young people get a start in the job market we must offer both short term help and long term hope for our unemployed i hope we can work together on this i hope we can work together as we did last year in enacting the landmark job training partnership act regulatory reform legislation a responsible clean air act and passage of enterprise zone legislation will also create new incentives for jobs and opportunity one of out of every five jobs in our country depends on trade so i will propose a broader strategy in the field of international trade one that increases the openness of our trading system and is fairer to america s farmers and workers in the world marketplace we must have adequate export financing to sell american products overseas i will ask for new negotiating authority to remove barriers and to get more of our products into foreign markets we must strengthen the organization of our trade agencies and make changes in our domestic laws and international trade policy to promote free trade and the increased flow of american goods services and investments our trade position can also be improved by making our port system more efficient better more active harbors translate into stable jobs in our coalfields railroads trucking industry and ports after 2 years of debate it s time for us to get together and enact a port modernization bill education training and retraining are fundamental to our success as are research and development and productivity labor management and government at all levels can and must participate in improving these tools of growth tax policy regulatory practices and government programs all need constant reevaluation in terms of our competitiveness every american has a role and a stake in international trade we americans are still the technological leaders in most fields we must keep that edge and to do so we need to begin renewing the basics starting with our educational system while we grew complacent others have acted japan with a population only about half the size of ours graduates from its universities more engineers than we do if a child doesn t receive adequate math and science teaching by the age of 16 he or she has lost the chance to be a scientist or an engineer we must join together parents teachers grass roots groups organized labor and the business community to revitalize american education by setting a standard of excellence in 1983 we seek four major education goals a quality education initiative to encourage a substantial upgrading of math and science instruction through block grants to the states establishment of education savings accounts that will give middle and lower income families an incentive to save for their children s college education and at the same time encourage a real increase in savings for economic growth passage of tuition tax credits for parents who want to send their children to private or religiously affiliated schools a constitutional amendment to permit voluntary school prayer god should never have been expelled from america s classrooms in the first place our commitment to fairness means that we must assure legal and economic equity for women and eliminate once and for all all traces of unjust discrimination against women from the united states code we will not tolerate wage discrimination based on sex and we intend to strengthen enforcement of child support laws to ensure that single parents most of whom are women do not suffer unfair financial hardship we will also take action to remedy inequities in pensions these initiatives will be joined by others to continue our efforts to promote equity for women also in the area of fairness and equity we will ask for extension of the civil rights commission which is due to expire this year the commission is an important part of the ongoing struggle for justice in america and we strongly support its reauthorization effective enforcement of our nation s fair housing laws is also essential to ensuring equal opportunity in the year ahead we ll work to strengthen enforcement of fair housing laws for all americans the time has also come for major reform of our criminal justice statutes and acceleration of the drive against organized crime and drug trafficking it s high time that we make our cities safe again this administration hereby declares an all out war on big time organized crime and the drug racketeers who are poisoning our young people we will also implement recommendations of our task force on victims of crime which will report to me this week american agriculture the envy of the world has become the victim of its own successes with one farmer now producing enough food to feed himself and 77 other people america is confronted with record surplus crops and commodity prices below the cost of production we must strive through innovations like the payment in kind crop swap approach and an aggressive export policy to restore health and vitality to rural america meanwhile i have instructed the department of agriculture to work individually with farmers with debt problems to help them through these tough times over the past year our task force on private sector initiatives has successfully forged a working partnership involving leaders of business labor education and government to address the training needs of american workers thanks to the task force private sector initiatives are now underway in all 50 states of the union and thousands of working people have been helped in making the shift from dead end jobs and low demand skills to the growth areas of high technology and the service economy additionally a major effort will be focused on encouraging the expansion of private community child care the new advisory council on private sector initiatives will carry on and extend this vital work of encouraging private initiative in 1983 in the coming year we will also act to improve the quality of life for americans by curbing the skyrocketing cost of health care that is becoming an unbearable financial burden for so many and we will submit legislation to provide catastrophic illness insurance coverage for older americans i will also shortly submit a comprehensive federalism proposal that will continue our efforts to restore to states and local governments their roles as dynamic laboratories of change in a creative society during the next several weeks i will send to the congress a series of detailed proposals on these and other topics and look forward to working with you on the development of these initiatives so far now i ve concentrated mainly on the problems posed by the future but in almost every home and workplace in america we re already witnessing reason for great hope the first flowering of the manmade miracles of high technology a field pioneered and still led by our country to many of us now computers silicon chips data processing cybernetics and all the other innovations of the dawning high technology age are as mystifying as the workings of the combustion engine must have been when that first model t rattled down main street u s a but as surely as america s pioneer spirit made us the industrial giant of the 20th century the same pioneer spirit today is opening up on another vast front of opportunity the frontier of high technology in conquering the frontier we cannot write off our traditional industries but we must develop the skills and industries that will make us a pioneer of tomorrow this administration is committed to keeping america the technological leader of the world now and into the 21st century but let us turn briefly to the international arena america s leadership in the world came to us because of our own strength and because of the values which guide us as a society free elections a free press freedom of religious choice free trade unions and above all freedom for the individual and rejection of the arbitrary power of the state these values are the bedrock of our strength they unite us in a stewardship of peace and freedom with our allies and friends in nato in asia in latin america and elsewhere they are also the values which in the recent past some among us had begun to doubt and view with a cynical eye fortunately we and our allies have rediscovered the strength of our common democratic values and we re applying them as a cornerstone of a comprehensive strategy for peace with freedom in london last year i announced the commitment of the united states to developing the infrastructure of democracy throughout the world we intend to pursue this democratic initiative vigorously the future belongs not to governments and ideologies which oppress their peoples but to democratic systems of self government which encourage individual initiative and guarantee personal freedom but our strategy for peace with freedom must also be based on strength economic strength and military strength a strong american economy is essential to the well being and security of our friends and allies the restoration of a strong healthy american economy has been and remains one of the central pillars of our foreign policy the progress i ve been able to report to you tonight will i know be as warmly welcomed by the rest of the world as it is by the american people we must also recognize that our own economic well being is inextricably linked to the world economy we export over 20 percent of our industrial production and 40 percent of our farmland produces for export we will continue to work closely with the industrialized democracies of europe and japan and with the international monetary fund to ensure it has adequate resources to help bring the world economy back to strong noninflationary growth as the leader of the west and as a country that has become great and rich because of economic freedom america must be an unrelenting advocate of free trade as some nations are tempted to turn to protectionism our strategy cannot be to follow them but to lead the way toward freer trade to this end in may of this year america will host an economic summit meeting in williamsburg virginia as we begin our third year we have put in place a defense program that redeems the neglect of the past decade we have developed a realistic military strategy to deter threats to peace and to protect freedom if deterrence fails our armed forces are finally properly paid after years of neglect are well trained and becoming better equipped and supplied and the american uniform is once again worn with pride most of the major systems needed for modernizing our defenses are already underway and we will be addressing one key system the mx missile in consultation with the congress in a few months america s foreign policy is once again based on bipartisanship on realism strength full partnership in consultation with our allies and constructive negotiation with potential adversaries from the middle east to southern africa to geneva american diplomats are taking the initiative to make peace and lower arms levels we should be proud of our role as peacemakers in the middle east last year the united states played the major role in ending the tragic fighting in lebanon and negotiated the withdrawal of the plo from beirut last september i outlined principles to carry on the peace process begun so promisingly at camp david all the people of the middle east should know that in the year ahead we will not flag in our efforts to build on that foundation to bring them the blessings of peace in central america and the caribbean basin we are likewise engaged in a partnership for peace prosperity and democracy final passage of the remaining portions of our caribbean basin initiative which passed the house last year is one of this administration s top legislative priorities for 1983 the security and economic assistance policies of this administration in latin america and elsewhere are based on realism and represent a critical investment in the future of the human race this undertaking is a joint responsibility of the executive and legislative branches and i m counting on the cooperation and statesmanship of the congress to help us meet this essential foreign policy goal at the heart of our strategy for peace is our relationship with the soviet union the past year saw a change in soviet leadership we re prepared for a positive change in soviet american relations but the soviet union must show by deeds as well as words a sincere commitment to respect the rights and sovereignty of the family of nations responsible members of the world community do not threaten or invade their neighbors and they restrain their allies from aggression for our part we re vigorously pursuing arms reduction negotiations with the soviet union supported by our allies we ve put forward draft agreements proposing significant weapon reductions to equal and verifiable lower levels we insist on an equal balance of forces and given the overwhelming evidence of soviet violations of international treaties concerning chemical and biological weapons we also insist that any agreement we sign can and will be verifiable in the case of intermediate range nuclear forces we have proposed the complete elimination of the entire class of land based missiles we re also prepared to carefully explore serious soviet proposals at the same time let me emphasize that allied steadfastness remains a key to achieving arms reductions with firmness and dedication we ll continue to negotiate deep down the soviets must know it s in their interest as well as ours to prevent a wasteful arms race and once they recognize our unshakable resolve to maintain adequate deterrence they will have every reason to join us in the search for greater security and major arms reductions when that moment comes and i m confident that it will we will have taken an important step toward a more peaceful future for all the world s people a very wise man bernard baruch once said that america has never forgotten the nobler things that brought her into being and that light her path our country is a special place because we americans have always been sustained through good times and bad by a noble vision a vision not only of what the world around us is today but what we as a free people can make it be tomorrow we re realists we solve our problems instead of ignoring them no matter how loud the chorus of despair around us but we re also idealists for it was an ideal that brought our ancestors to these shores from every corner of the world right now we need both realism and idealism millions of our neighbors are without work it is up to us to see they aren t without hope this is a task for all of us and may i say americans have rallied to this cause proving once again that we are the most generous people on earth we who are in government must take the lead in restoring the economy applause and here all that time i thought you were reading the paper laughter the single thing the single thing that can start the wheels of industry turning again is further reduction of interest rates just another 1 or 2 points can mean tens of thousands of jobs right now with inflation as low as it is 3 9 percent there is room for interest rates to come down only fear prevents their reduction a lender as we know must charge an interest rate that recovers the depreciated value of the dollars loaned and that depreciation is of course the amount of inflation today interest rates are based on fear fear that government will resort to measures as it has in the past that will send inflation zooming again we who serve here in this capital must erase that fear by making it absolutely clear that we will not stop fighting inflation that together we will do only those things that will lead to lasting economic growth yes the problems confronting us are large and forbidding and certainly no one can or should minimize the plight of millions of our friends and neighbors who are living in the bleak emptiness of unemployment but we must and can give them good reason to be hopeful back over the years citizens like ourselves have gathered within these walls when our nation was threatened sometimes when its very existence was at stake always with courage and common sense they met the crises of their time and lived to see a stronger better and more prosperous country the present situation is no worse and in fact is not as bad as some of those they faced time and again they proved that there is nothing we americans cannot achieve as free men and women yes we still have problems plenty of them but it s just plain wrong unjust to our country and unjust to our people to let those problems stand in the way of the most important truth of all america is on the mend we owe it to the unfortunate to be aware of their plight and to help them in every way we can no one can quarrel with that we must and do have compassion for all the victims of this economic crisis but the big story about america today is the way that millions of confident caring people those extraordinary ordinary americans who never make the headlines and will never be interviewed are laying the foundation not just for recovery from our present problems but for a better tomorrow for all our people from coast to coast on the job and in classrooms and laboratories at new construction sites and in churches and community groups neighbors are helping neighbors and they ve already begun the building the research the work and the giving that will make our country great again i believe this because i believe in them in the strength of their hearts and minds in the commitment that each one of them brings to their daily lives be they high or humble the challenge for us in government is to be worthy of them to make government a help not a hindrance to our people in the challenging but promising days ahead if we do that if we care what our children and our children s children will say of us if we want them one day to be thankful for what we did here in these temples of freedom we will work together to make america better for our having been here not just in this year or this decade but in the next century and beyond thank you and god bless you

to the senate and house of representatives the nation continues to enjoy noteworthy prosperity such prosperity is of course primarily due to the high individual average of our citizenship taken together with our great natural resources but an important factor therein is the working of our long continued governmental policies the people have emphatically expressed their approval of the principles underlying these policies and their desire that these principles be kept substantially unchanged although of course applied in a progressive spirit to meet changing conditions the enlargement of scope of the functions of the national government required by our development as a nation involves of course increase of expense and the period of prosperity through which the country is passing justifies expenditures for permanent improvements far greater than would be wise in hard times battle ships and forts public buildings and improved waterways are investments which should be made when we have the money but abundant revenues and a large surplus always invite extravagance and constant care should be taken to guard against unnecessary increase of the ordinary expenses of government the cost of doing government business should be regulated with the same rigid scrutiny as the cost of doing a private business in the vast and complicated mechanism of our modern civilized life the dominant note is the note of industralism and the relations of capital and labor and especially of organized capital and organized labor to each other and to the public at large come second in importance only to the intimate questions of family life our peculiar form of government with its sharp division of authority between the nation and the several states has been on the whole far more advantageous to our development than a more strongly centralized government but it is undoubtedly responsible for much of the difficulty of meeting with adequate legislation the new problems presented by the total change in industrial conditions on this continent during the last half century in actual practice it has proved exceedingly difficult and in many cases impossible to get unanimity of wise action among the various states on these subjects from the very nature of the case this is especially true of the laws affecting the employment of capital in huge masses with regard to labor the problem is no less important but it is simpler as long as the states retain the primary control of the police power the circumstances must be altogether extreme which require interference by the federal authorities whether in the way of safeguarding the rights of labor or in the way of seeing that wrong is not done by unruly persons who shield themselves behind the name of labor if there is resistance to the federal courts interference with the mails or interstate commerce or molestation of federal property or if the state authorities in some crisis which they are unable to face call for help then the federal government may interfere but though such interference may be caused by a condition of things arising out of trouble connected with some question of labor the interference itself simply takes the form of restoring order without regard to the questions which have caused the breach of order for to keep order is a primary duty and in a time of disorder and violence all other questions sink into abeyance until order has been restored in the district of columbia and in the territories the federal law covers the entire field of government but the labor question is only acute in populous centers of commerce manufactures or mining nevertheless both in the enactment and in the enforcement of law the federal government within its restricted sphere should set an example to the state governments especially in a matter so vital as this affecting labor i believe that under modern industrial conditions it is often necessary and even where not necessary it is yet often wise that there should be organization of labor in order better to secure the rights of the individual wage worker all encouragement should be given to any such organization so long as it is conducted with a due and decent regard for the rights of others there are in this country some labor unions which have habitually and other labor unions which have often been among the most effective agents in working for good citizenship and for uplifting the condition of those whose welfare should be closest to our hearts but when any labor union seeks improper ends or seeks to achieve proper ends by improper means all good citizens and more especially all honorable public servants must oppose the wrongdoing as resolutely as they would oppose the wrongdoing of any great corporation of course any violence brutality or corruption should not for one moment be tolerated wage workers have an entire right to organize and by all peaceful and honorable means to endeavor to persuade their fellows to join with them in organizations they have a legal right which according to circumstances may or may not be a moral right to refuse to work in company with men who decline to join their organizations they have under no circumstances the right to commit violence upon these whether capitalists or wage workers who refuse to support their organizations or who side with those with whom they are at odds for mob rule is intolerable in any form the wage workers are peculiarly entitled to the protection and the encouragement of the law from the very nature of their occupation railroad men for instance are liable to be maimed in doing the legitimate work of their profession unless the railroad companies are required by law to make ample provision for their safety the administration has been zealous in enforcing the existing law for this purpose that law should be amended and strengthened wherever the national government has power there should be a stringent employer s liability law which should apply to the government itself where the government is an employer of labor in my message to the fifty seventh congress at its second session i urged the passage of an employer s liability law for the district of columbia i now renew that recommendation and further recommend that the congress appoint a commission to make a comprehensive study of employer s liability with the view of extending the provisions of a great and constitutional law to all employments within the scope of federal power the government has recognized heroism upon the water and bestows medals of honor upon those persons who by extreme and heroic daring have endangered their lives in saving or endeavoring to save lives from the perils of the sea in the waters over which the united states has jurisdiction or upon an american vessel this recognition should be extended to cover cases of conspicuous bravery and self sacrifice in the saving of life in private employments under the jurisdiction of the united states and particularly in the land commerce of the nation the ever increasing casualty list upon our railroads is a matter of grave public concern and urgently calls for action by the congress in the matter of speed and comfort of railway travel our railroads give at least as good service as those of any other nation and there is no reason why this service should not also be as safe as human ingenuity can make it many of our leading roads have been foremost in the adoption of the most approved safeguards for the protection of travelers and employees yet the list of clearly avoidable accidents continues unduly large the passage of a law requiring the adoption of a block signal system has been proposed to the congress i earnestly concur in that recommendation and would also point out to the congress the urgent need of legislation in the interest of the public safety limiting the hours of labor for railroad employees in train service upon railroads engaged in interstate commerce and providing that only trained and experienced persons be employed in positions of responsibility connected with the operation of trains of course nothing can ever prevent accidents caused by human weakness or misconduct and there should be drastic punishment for any railroad employee whether officer or man who by issuance of wrong orders or by disobedience of orders causes disaster the law of 1901 requiring interstate railroads to make monthly reports of all accidents to passengers and employees on duty should also be amended so as to empower the government to make a personal investigation through proper officers of all accidents involving loss of life which seem to require investigation with a requirement that the results of such investigation be made public the safety appliance law as amended by the act of march 2 1903 has proved beneficial to railway employees and in order that its provisions may be properly carried out the force of inspectors provided for by appropriation should be largely increased this service is analogous to the steamboat inspection service and deals with even more important interests it has passed the experimental stage and demonstrated its utility and should receive generous recognition by the congress there is no objection to employees of the government forming or belonging to unions but the government can neither discriminate for nor discriminate against nonunion men who are in its employment or who seek to be employed under it moreover it is a very grave impropriety for government employees to band themselves together for the purpose of extorting improperly high salaries from the government especially is this true of those within the classified service the letter carriers both municipal and rural are as a whole an excellent body of public servants they should be amply paid but their payment must be obtained by arguing their claims fairly and honorably before the congress and not by banding together for the defeat of those congressmen who refuse to give promises which they can not in conscience give the administration has already taken steps to prevent and punish abuses of this nature but it will be wise for the congress to supplement this action by legislation much can be done by the government in labor matters merely by giving publicity to certain conditions the bureau of labor has done excellent work of this kind in many different directions i shall shortly lay before you in a special message the full report of the investigation of the bureau of labor into the colorado mining strike as this was a strike in which certain very evil forces which are more or less at work everywhere under the conditions of modern industrialism became startlingly prominent it is greatly to be wished that the department of commerce and labor through the labor bureau should compile and arrange for the congress a list of the labor laws of the various states and should be given the means to investigate and report to the congress upon the labor conditions in the manufacturing and mining regions throughout the country both as to wages as to hours of labor as to the labor of women and children and as to the effect in the various labor centers of immigration from abroad in this investigation especial attention should be paid to the conditions of child labor and child labor legislation in the several states such an investigation must necessarily take into account many of the problems with which this question of child labor is connected these problems can be actually met in most cases only by the states themselves but the lack of proper legislation in one state in such a matter as child labor often renders it excessively difficult to establish protective restriction upon the work in another state having the same industries so that the worst tends to drag down the better for this reason it would be well for the nation at least to endeavor to secure comprehensive information as to the conditions of labor of children in the different states such investigation and publication by the national government would tend toward the securing of approximately uniform legislation of the proper character among the several states when we come to deal with great corporations the need for the government to act directly is far greater than in the case of labor because great corporations can become such only by engaging in interstate commerce and interstate commerce is peculiarly the field of the general government it is an absurdity to expect to eliminate the abuses in great corporations by state action it is difficult to be patient with an argument that such matters should be left to the states because more than one state pursues the policy of creating on easy terms corporations which are never operated within that state at all but in other states whose laws they ignore the national government alone can deal adequately with these great corporations to try to deal with them in an intemperate destructive or demagogic spirit would in all probability mean that nothing whatever would be accomplished and with absolute certainty that if anything were accomplished it would be of a harmful nature the american people need to continue to show the very qualities that they have shown that is moderation good sense the earnest desire to avoid doing any damage and yet the quiet determination to proceed step by step without halt and without hurry in eliminating or at least in minimizing whatever of mischief or evil there is to interstate commerce in the conduct of great corporations they are acting in no spirit of hostility to wealth either individual or corporate they are not against the rich man any more than against the poor man on the contrary they are friendly alike toward rich man and toward poor man provided only that each acts in a spirit of justice and decency toward his fellows great corporations are necessary and only men of great and singular mental power can manage such corporations successfully and such men must have great rewards but these corporations should be managed with due regard to the interest of the public as a whole where this can be done under the present laws it must be done where these laws come short others should be enacted to supplement them yet we must never forget the determining factor in every kind of work of head or hand must be the man s own good sense courage and kindliness more important than any legislation is the gradual growth of a feeling of responsibility and forbearance among capitalists and wage workers alike a feeling of respect on the part of each man for the rights of others a feeling of broad community of interest not merely of capitalists among themselves and of wage workers among themselves but of capitalists and wage workers in their relations to each other and of both in their relations to their fellows who with them make up the body politic there are many captains of industry many labor leaders who realize this a recent speech by the president of one of our great railroad systems to the employees of that system contains sound common sense it rims in part as follows it is my belief we can better serve each other better understand the man as well as his business when meeting face to face exchanging views and realizing from personal contact we serve but one interest that of our mutual prosperity serious misunderstandings can not occur where personal good will exists and opportunity for personal explanation is present in my early business life i had experience with men of affairs of a character to make me desire to avoid creating a like feeling of resentment to myself and the interests in my charge should fortune ever place me in authority and i am solicitous of a measure of confidence on the part of the public and our employees that i shall hope may be warranted by the fairness and good fellowship i intend shall prevail in our relationship but do not feel i am disposed to grant unreasonable requests spend the money of our company unnecessarily or without value received nor expect the days of mistakes are disappearing or that cause for complaint will not continually occur simply to correct such abuses as may be discovered to better conditions as fast as reasonably may be expected constantly striving with varying success for that improvement we all desire to convince you there is a force at work in the right direction all the time making progress is the disposition with which i have come among you asking your good will and encouragement the day has gone by when a corporation can be handled successfully in defiance of the public will even though that will be unreasonable and wrong a public may be led but not driven and i prefer to go with it and shape or modify in a measure its opinion rather than be swept from my bearings with loss to myself and the interests in my charge violent prejudice exists towards corporate activity and capital today much of it founded in reason more in apprehension and a large measure is due to the personal traits of arbitrary unreasonable incompetent and offensive men in positions of authority the accomplishment of results by indirection the endeavor to thwart the intention if not the expressed letter of the law the will of the people a disregard of the rights of others a disposition to withhold what is due to force by main strength or inactivity a result not justified depending upon the weakness of the claimant and his indisposition to become involved in litigation has created a sentiment harmful in the extreme and a disposition to consider anything fair that gives gain to the individual at the expense of the company if corporations are to continue to do the world s work as they are best fitted to these qualities in their representatives that have resulted in the present prejudice against them must be relegated to the background the corporations must come out into the open and see and be seen they must take the public into their confidence and ask for what they want and no more and be prepared to explain satisfactorily what advantage will accrue to the public if they are given their desires for they are permitted to exist not that they may make money solely but that they may effectively serve those from whom they derive their power publicity and not secrecy will win hereafter and laws be construed by their intent and not by their letter otherwise public utilities will be owned and operated by the public which created them even though the service be less efficient and the result less satisfactory from a financial standpoint the bureau of corporations has made careful preliminary investigation of many important corporations it will make a special report on the beef industry the policy of the bureau is to accomplish the purposes of its creation by co operation not antagonism by making constructive legislation not destructive prosecution the immediate object of its inquiries by conservative investigation of law and fact and by refusal to issue incomplete and hence necessarily inaccurate reports its policy being thus one of open inquiry into and not attack upon business the bureau has been able to gain not only the confidence but better still the cooperation of men engaged in legitimate business the bureau offers to the congress the means of getting at the cost of production of our various great staples of commerce of necessity the careful investigation of special corporations will afford the commissioner knowledge of certain business facts the publication of which might be an improper infringement of private rights the method of making public the results of these investigations affords under the law a means for the protection of private rights the congress will have all facts except such as would give to another corporation information which would injure the legitimate business of a competitor and destroy the incentive for individual superiority and thrift the bureau has also made exhaustive examinations into the legal condition under which corporate business is carried on in the various states into all judicial decisions on the subject and into the various systems of corporate taxation in use i call special attention to the report of the chief of the bureau and i earnestly ask that the congress carefully consider the report and recommendations of the commissioner on this subject the business of insurance vitally affects the great mass of the people of the united states and is national and not local in its application it involves a multitude of transactions among the people of the different states and between american companies and foreign governments i urge that the congress carefully consider whether the power of the bureau of corporations can not constitutionally be extended to cover interstate transactions in insurance above all else we must strive to keep the highways of commerce open to all on equal terms and to do this it is necessary to put a complete stop to all rebates whether the shipper or the railroad is to blame makes no difference the rebate must be stopped the abuses of the private car and private terminal track and side track systems must be stopped and the legislation of the fifty eighth congress which declares it to be unlawful for any person or corporation to offer gram give solicit accept or receive any rebate concession or discrimination in respect of the transportation of any property in interstate or foreign commerce whereby such property shall by any device whatever be transported at a less rate than that named in the tariffs published by the carrier must be enforced for some time after the enactment of the act to regulate commerce it remained a mooted question whether that act conferred upon the interstate commerce commission the power after it had found a challenged rate to be unreasonable to declare what thereafter should prima facie be the reasonable maximum rate for the transportation in dispute the supreme court finally resolved that question in the negative so that as the law now stands the commission simply possess the bare power to denounce a particular rate as unreasonable while i am of the opinion that at present it would be undesirable if it were not impracticable finally to clothe the commission with general authority to fix railroad rates i do believe that as a fair security to shippers the commission should be vested with the power where a given rate has been challenged and after full hearing found to be unreasonable to decide subject to judicial review what shall be a reasonable rate to take its place the ruling of the commission to take effect immediately and to obtain unless and until it is reversed by the court of review the government must in increasing degree supervise and regulate the workings of the railways engaged in interstate commerce and such increased supervision is the only alternative to an increase of the present evils on the one hand or a still more radical policy on the other in my judgment the most important legislative act now needed as regards the regulation of corporations is this act to confer on the interstate commerce commission the power to revise rates and regulations the revised rate to at once go into effect and stay in effect unless and until the court of review reverses it steamship companies engaged in interstate commerce and protected in our coastwise trade should be held to a strict observance of the interstate commerce act in pursuing the set plan to make the city of washington an example to other american municipalities several points should be kept in mind by the legislators in the first place the people of this country should clearly understand that no amount of industrial prosperity and above all no leadership in international industrial competition can in any way atone for the sapping of the vitality of those who are usually spoken of as the working classes the farmers the mechanics the skilled and unskilled laborers the small shop keepers make up the bulk of the population of any country and upon their well being generation after generation the well being of the country and the race depends rapid development in wealth and industrial leadership is a good thing but only if it goes hand in hand with improvement and not deterioration physical and moral the over crowding of cities and the draining of country districts are unhealthy and even dangerous symptoms in our modern life we should not permit overcrowding in cities in certain european cities it is provided by law that the population of towns shall not be allowed to exceed a very limited density for a given area so that the increase in density must be continually pushed back into a broad zone around the center of the town this zone having great avenues or parks within it the death rate statistics show a terrible increase in mortality and especially in infant mortality in overcrowded tenements the poorest families in tenement houses live in one room and it appears that in these one room tenements the average death rate for a number of given cities at home and abroad is about twice what it is in a two room tenement four times what it is in a three room tenement and eight times what it is in a tenement consisting of four rooms or over these figures vary somewhat for different cities but they approximate in each city those given above and in all cases the increase of mortality and especially of infant mortality with the decrease in the number of rooms used by the family and with the consequent overcrowding is startling the slum exacts a heavy total of death from those who dwell therein and this is the case not merely in the great crowded slums of high buildings in new york and chicago but in the alley slums of washington in washington people can not afford to ignore the harm that this causes no christian and civilized community can afford to show a happy go lucky lack of concern for the youth of to day for if so the community will have to pay a terrible penalty of financial burden and social degradation in the to morrow there should be severe child labor and factory inspection laws it is very desirable that married women should not work in factories the prime duty of the man is to work to be the breadwinner the prime duty of the woman is to be the mother the housewife all questions of tariff and finance sink into utter insignificance when compared with the tremendous the vital importance of trying to shape conditions so that these two duties of the man and of the woman can be fulfilled under reasonably favorable circumstances if a race does not have plenty of children or if the children do not grow up or if when they grow up they are unhealthy in body and stunted or vicious in mind then that race is decadent and no heaping up of wealth no splendor of momentary material prosperity can avail in any degree as offsets the congress has the same power of legislation for the district of columbia which the state legislatures have for the various states the problems incident to our highly complex modern industrial civilization with its manifold and perplexing tendencies both for good and for evil are far less sharply eccentuated in the city of washington than in most other cities for this very reason it is easier to deal with the various phases of these problems in washington and the district of columbia government should be a model for the other municipal governments of the nation in all such matters as supervision of the housing of the poor the creation of small parks in the districts inhabited by the poor in laws affecting labor in laws providing for the taking care of the children in truant laws and in providing schools in the vital matter of taking care of children much advantage could be gained by a careful study of what has been accomplished in such states as illinois and colorado by the juvenile courts the work of the juvenile court is really a work of character building it is now generally recognized that young boys and young girls who go wrong should not be treated as criminals not even necessarily as needing reformation but rather as needing to have their characters formed and for this end to have them tested and developed by a system of probation much admirable work has been done in many of our commonwealths by earnest men and women who have made a special study of the needs of those classes of children which furnish the greatest number of juvenile offenders and therefore the greatest number of adult offenders and by their aid and by profiting by the experiences of the different states and cities in these matters it would be easy to provide a good code for the district of columbia several considerations suggest the need for a systematic investigation into and improvement of housing conditions in washington the hidden residential alleys are breeding grounds of vice and disease and should be opened into minor streets for a number of years influential citizens have joined with the district commissioners in the vain endeavor to secure laws permitting the condemnation of insanitary dwellings the local death rates especially from preventable diseases are so unduly high as to suggest that the exceptional wholesomeness of washington s better sections is offset by bad conditions in her poorer neighborhoods a special commission on housing and health conditions in the national capital would not only bring about the reformation of existing evils but would also formulate an appropriate building code to protect the city from mammoth brick tenements and other evils which threaten to develop here as they have in other cities that the nation s capital should be made a model for other municipalities is an ideal which appeals to all patriotic citizens everywhere and such a special commission might map out and organize the city s future development in lines of civic social service just as major l enfant and the recent park commission planned the arrangement of her streets and parks it is mortifying to remember that washington has no compulsory school attendance law and that careful inquiries indicate the habitual absence from school of some twenty per cent of all children between the ages of eight and fourteen it must be evident to all who consider the problems of neglected child life or the benefits of compulsory education in other cities that one of the most urgent needs of the national capital is a law requiring the school attendance of all children this law to be enforced by attendance agents directed by the board of education public play grounds are necessary means for the development of wholesome citizenship in modern cities it is important that the work inaugurated here through voluntary efforts should be taken up and extended through congressional appropriation of funds sufficient to equip and maintain numerous convenient small play grounds upon land which can be secured without purchase or rental it is also desirable that small vacant places be purchased and reserved as small park play grounds in densely settled sections of the city which now have no public open spaces and are destined soon to be built up solidly all these needs should be met immediately to meet them would entail expenses but a corresponding saving could be made by stopping the building of streets and levelling of ground for purposes largely speculative in outlying parts of the city there are certain offenders whose criminality takes the shape of brutality and cruelty towards the weak who need a special type of punishment the wife beater for example is inadequately punished by imprisonment for imprisonment may often mean nothing to him while it may cause hunger and want to the wife and children who have been the victims of his brutality probably some form of corporal punishment would be the most adequate way of meeting this kind of crime the department of agriculture has grown into an educational institution with a faculty of two thousand specialists making research into all the sciences of production the congress appropriates directly and indirectly six millions of dollars annually to carry on this work it reaches every state and territory in the union and the islands of the sea lately come under our flag co operation is had with the state experiment stations and with many other institutions and individuals the world is carefully searched for new varieties of grains fruits grasses vegetables trees and shrubs suitable to various localities in our country and marked benefit to our producers has resulted the activities of our age in lines of research have reached the tillers of the soil and inspired them with ambition to know more of the principles that govern the forces of nature with which they have to deal nearly half of the people of this country devote their energies to growing things from the soil until a recent date little has been done to prepare these millions for their life work in most lines of human activity college trained men are the leaders the farmer had no opportunity for special training until the congress made provision for it forty years ago during these years progress has been made and teachers have been prepared over five thousand students are in attendance at our state agricultural colleges the federal government expends ten millions of dollars annually toward this education and for research in washington and in the several states and territories the department of agriculture has given facilities for post graduate work to five hundred young men during the last seven years preparing them for advance lines of work in the department and in the state institutions the facts concerning meteorology and its relations to plant and animal life are being systematically inquired into temperature and moisture are controlling factors in all agricultural operations the seasons of the cyclones of the caribbean sea and their paths are being forecasted with increasing accuracy the cold winds that come from the north are anticipated and their times and intensity told to farmers gardeners and fruiterers in all southern localities we sell two hundred and fifty million dollars worth of animals and animal products to foreign countries every year in addition to supplying our own people more cheaply and abundantly than any other nation is able to provide for its people successful manufacturing depends primarily on cheap food which accounts to a considerable extent for our growth in this direction the department of agriculture by careful inspection of meats guards the health of our people and gives clean bills of health to deserving exports it is prepared to deal promptly with imported diseases of animals and maintain the excellence of our flocks and herds in this respect there should be an annual census of the live stock of the nation we sell abroad about six hundred million dollars worth of plants and their products every year strenuous efforts are being made to import from foreign countries such grains as are suitable to our varying localities seven years ago we bought three fourths of our rice by helping the rice growers on the gulf coast to secure seeds from the orient suited to their conditions and by giving them adequate protection they now supply home demand and export to the islands of the caribbean sea and to other rice growing countries wheat and other grains have been imported from light rainfall countries to our lands in the west and southwest that have not grown crops because of light precipitation resulting in an extensive addition to our cropping area and our home making territory that can not be irrigated ten million bushels of first class macaroni wheat were grown from these experimental importations last year fruits suitable to our soils and climates are being imported from all the countries of the old world the fig from turkey the almond from spain the date from algeria the mango from india we are helping our fruit growers to get their crops into european markets by studying methods of preservation through refrigeration packing and handling which have been quite successful we are helping our hop growers by importing varieties that ripen earlier and later than the kinds they have been raising thereby lengthening the harvesting season the cotton crop of the country is threatened with root rot the bollworm and the boll weevil our pathologists will find immune varieties that will resist the root disease and the bollworm can be dealt with but the boll weevil is a serious menace to the cotton crop it is a central american insect that has become acclimated in texas and has done great damage a scientist of the department of agriculture has found the weevil at home in guatemala being kept in check by an ant which has been brought to our cotton fields for observation it is hoped that it may serve a good purpose the soils of the country are getting attention from the farmer s standpoint and interesting results are following we have duplicates of the soils that grow the wrapper tobacco in sumatra and the filler tobacco in cuba it will be only a question of time when the large amounts paid to these countries will be paid to our own people the reclamation of alkali lands is progressing to give object lessons to our people in methods by which worthless lands may be made productive the insect friends and enemies of the farmer are getting attention the enemy of the san jose scale was found near the great wall of china and is now cleaning up all our orchards the fig fertilizing insect imported from turkey has helped to establish an industry in california that amounts to from fifty to one hundred tons of dried figs annually and is extending over the pacific coast a parasitic fly from south africa is keeping in subjection the black scale the worst pest of the orange and lemon industry in california careful preliminary work is being done towards producing our own silk the mulberry is being distributed in large numbers eggs are being imported and distributed improved reels were imported from europe last year and two expert reelers were brought to washington to reel the crop of cocoons and teach the art to our own people the crop reporting system of the department of agriculture is being brought closer to accuracy every year it has two hundred and fifty thousand reporters selected from people in eight vocations in life it has arrangements with most european countries for interchange of estimates so that our people may know as nearly as possible with what they must compete during the two and a half years that have elapsed since the passage of the reclamation act rapid progress has been made in the surveys and examinations of the opportunities for reclamation in the thirteen states and three territories of the arid west construction has already been begun on the largest and most important of the irrigation works and plans are being completed for works which will utilize the funds now available the operations are being carried on by the reclamation service a corps of engineers selected through competitive civil service examinations this corps includes experienced consulting and constructing engineers as well as various experts in mechanical and legal matters and is composed largely of men who have spent most of their lives in practical affairs connected with irrigation the larger problems have been solved and it now remains to execute with care economy and thoroughness the work which has been laid out all important details are being carefully considered by boards of consulting engineers selected for their thorough knowledge and practical experience each project is taken up on the ground by competent men and viewed from the standpoint of the creation of prosperous homes and of promptly refunding to the treasury the cost of construction the reclamation act has been found to be remarkably complete and effective and so broad in its provisions that a wide range of undertakings has been possible under it at the same time economy is guaranteed by the fact that the funds must ultimately be returned to be used over again it is the cardinal principle of the forest reserve policy of this administration that the reserves are for use whatever interferes with the use of their resources is to be avoided by every possible means but these resources must be used in such a way as to make them permanent the forest policy of the government is just now a subject of vivid public interest throughout the west and to the people of the united states in general the forest reserves themselves are of extreme value to the present as well as to the future welfare of all the western public land states they powerfully affect the use and disposal of the public lands they are of special importance because they preserve the water supply and the supply of timber for domestic purposes and so promote settlement under the reclamation act indeed they are essential to the welfare of every one of the great interests of the west forest reserves are created for two principal purposes the first is to preserve the water supply this is their most important use the principal users of the water thus preserved are irrigation ranchers and settlers cities and towns to whom their municipal water supplies are of the very first importance users and furnishers of water power and the users of water for domestic manufacturing mining and other purposes all these are directly dependent upon the forest reserves the second reason for which forest reserves are created is to preserve the timber supply for various classes of wood users among the more important of these are settlers under the reclamation act and other acts for whom a cheap and accessible supply of timber for domestic uses is absolutely necessary miners and prospectors who are in serious danger of losing their timber supply by fire or through export by lumber companies when timber lands adjacent to their mines pass into private ownership lumbermen transportation companies builders and commercial interests in general although the wisdom of creating forest reserves is nearly everywhere heartily recognized yet in a few localities there has been misunderstanding and complaint the following statement is therefore desirable the forest reserve policy can be successful only when it has the full support of the people of the west it can not safely and should not in any case be imposed upon them against their will but neither can we accept the views of those whose only interest in the forest is temporary who are anxious to reap what they have not sown and then move away leaving desolation behind them on the contrary it is everywhere and always the interest of the permanent settler and the permanent business man the man with a stake in the country which must be considered and which must decide the making of forest reserves within railroad and wagon road land grant limits will hereafter as for the past three years be so managed as to prevent the issue under the act of june 4 1897 of base for exchange or lieu selection usually called scrip in all cases where forest reserves within areas covered by land grants appear to be essential to the prosperity of settlers miners or others the government lands within such proposed forest reserves will as in the recent past be withdrawn from sale or entry pending the completion of such negotiations with the owners of the land grants as will prevent the creation of so called scrip it was formerly the custom to make forest reserves without first getting definite and detailed information as to the character of land and timber within their boundaries this method of action often resulted in badly chosen boundaries and consequent injustice to settlers and others therefore this administration adopted the present method of first withdrawing the land from disposal followed by careful examination on the ground and the preparation of detailed maps and descriptions before any forest reserve is created i have repeatedly called attention to the confusion which exists in government forest matters because the work is scattered among three independent organizations the united states is the only one of the great nations in which the forest work of the government is not concentrated under one department in consonance with the plainest dictates of good administration and common sense the present arrangement is bad from every point of view merely to mention it is to prove that it should be terminated at once as i have repeatedly recommended all the forest work of the government should be concentrated in the department of agriculture where the larger part of that work is already done where practically all of the trained foresters of the government are employed where chiefly in washington there is comprehensive first class knowledge of the problems of the reserves acquired on the ground where all problems relating to growth from the soil are already gathered and where all the sciences auxiliary to forestry are at hand for prompt and effective co operation these reasons are decisive in themselves but it should be added that the great organizations of citizens whose interests are affected by the forest reserves such as the national live stock association the national wool growers association the american mining congress the national irrigation congress and the national board of trade have uniformly emphatically and most of them repeatedly expressed themselves in favor of placing all government forest work in the department of agriculture because of the peculiar adaptation of that department for it it is true also that the forest services of nearly all the great nations of the world are under the respective departments of agriculture while in but two of the smaller nations and in one colony are they under the department of the interior this is the result of long and varied experience and it agrees fully with the requirements of good administration in our own case the creation of a forest service in the department of agriculture will have for its important results first a better handling of all forest work because it will be under a single head and because the vast and indispensable experience of the department in all matters pertaining to the forest reserves to forestry in general and to other forms of production from the soil will be easily and rapidly accessible second the reserves themselves being handled from the point of view of the man in the field instead of the man in the office will be more easily and more widely useful to the people of the west than has been the case hitherto third within a comparatively short time the reserves will become self supporting this is important because continually and rapidly increasing appropriations will be necessary for the proper care of this exceedingly important interest of the nation and they can and should he offset by returns from the national forests under similar circumstances the forest possessions of other great nations form an important source of revenue to their governments every administrative officer concerned is convinced of the necessity for the proposed consolidation of forest work in the department of agriculture and i myself have urged it more than once in former messages again i commend it to the early and favorable consideration of the congress the interests of the nation at large and of the west in particular have suffered greatly because of the delay i call the attention of the congress again to the report and recommendation of the commission on the public lands forwarded by me to the second session of the present congress the commission has prosecuted its investigations actively during the past season and a second report is now in an advanced stage of preparation in connection with the work of the forest reserves i desire again to urge upon the congress the importance of authorizing the president to set aside certain portions of these reserves or other public lands as game refuges for the preservation of the bison the wapiti and other large beasts once so abundant in our woods and mountains and on our great plains and now tending toward extinction every support should be given to the authorities of the yellowstone park in their successful efforts at preserving the large creatures therein and at very little expense portions of the public domain in other regions which are wholly unsuited to agricultural settlement could be similarly utilized we owe it to future generations to keep alive the noble and beautiful creatures which by their presence add such distinctive character to the american wilderness the limits of the yellowstone park should be extended southwards the canyon of the colorado should be made a national park and the national park system should include the yosemite and as many as possible of the groves of giant trees in california the veterans of the civil war have a claim upon the nation such as no other body of our citizens possess the pension bureau has never in its history been managed in a more satisfactory manner than is now the case the progress of the indians toward civilization though not rapid is perhaps all that could be hoped for in view of the circumstances within the past year many tribes have shown in a degree greater than ever before an appreciation of the necessity of work this changed attitude is in part due to the policy recently pursued of reducing the amount of subsistence to the indians and thus forcing them through sheer necessity to work for a livelihood the policy though severe is a useful one but it is to be exercised only with judgment and with a full understanding of the conditions which exist in each community for which it is intended on or near the indian reservations there is usually very little demand for labor and if the indians are to earn their living and when work can not be furnished from outside which is always preferable then it must be furnished by the government practical instruction of this kind would in a few years result in the forming of habits of regular industry which would render the indian a producer and would effect a great reduction in the cost of his maintenance it is commonly declared that the slow advance of the indians is due to the unsatisfactory character of the men appointed to take immediate charge of them and to some extent this is true while the standard of the employees in the indian service shows great improvement over that of bygone years and while actual corruption or flagrant dishonesty is now the rare exception it is nevertheless the fact that the salaries paid indian agents are not large enough to attract the best men to that field of work to achieve satisfactory results the official in charge of an indian tribe should possess the high qualifications which are required in the manager of a large business but only in exceptional cases is it possible to secure men of such a type for these positions much better service however might be obtained from those now holding the places were it practicable to get out of them the best that is in them and this should be done by bringing them constantly into closer touch with their superior officers an agent who has been content to draw his salary giving in return the least possible equivalent in effort and service may by proper treatment by suggestion and encouragement or persistent urging be stimulated to greater effort and induced to take a more active personal interest in his work under existing conditions an indian agent in the distant west may be wholly out of touch with the office of the indian bureau he may very well feel that no one takes a personal interest in him or his efforts certain routine duties in the way of reports and accounts are required of him but there is no one with whom he may intelligently consult on matters vital to his work except after long delay such a man would be greatly encouraged and aided by personal contact with some one whose interest in indian affairs and whose authority in the indian bureau were greater than his own and such contact would be certain to arouse and constantly increase the interest he takes in his work the distance which separates the agents the workers in the field from the indian office in washington is a chief obstacle to indian progress whatever shall more closely unite these two branches of the indian service and shall enable them to co operate more heartily and more effectively will be for the increased efficiency of the work and the betterment of the race for whose improvement the indian bureau was established the appointment of a field assistant to the commissioner of indian affairs would be certain to insure this good end such an official if possessed of the requisite energy and deep interest in the work would be a most efficient factor in bringing into closer relationship and a more direct union of effort the bureau in washington and its agents in the field and with the co operation of its branches thus secured the indian bureau would in measure fuller than ever before lift up the savage toward that self help and self reliance which constitute the man in 1907 there will be held at hampton roads the tricentennial celebration of the settlement at jamestown virginia with which the history of what has now become the united states really begins i commend this to your favorable consideration it is an event of prime historic significance in which all the people of the united states should feel and should show great and general interest in the post office department the service has increased in efficiency and conditions as to revenue and expenditure continue satisfactory the increase of revenue during the year was 9 358 181 10 or 6 9 per cent the total receipts amounting to 143 382 624 34 the expenditures were 152 362 116 70 an increase of about 9 per cent over the previous year being thus 8 979 492 36 in excess of the current revenue included in these expenditures was a total appropriation of 152 956 637 35 for the continuation and extension of the rural free delivery service which was an increase of 4 902 237 35 over the amount expended for this purpose in the preceding fiscal year large as this expenditure has been the beneficent results attained in extending the free distribution of mails to the residents of rural districts have justified the wisdom of the outlay statistics brought down to the 1st of october 1904 show that on that date there were 27 138 rural routes established serving approximately 12 000 000 of people in rural districts remote from post offices and that there were pending at that time 3 859 petitions for the establishment of new rural routes unquestionably some part of the general increase in receipts is due to the increased postal facilities which the rural service has afforded the revenues have also been aided greatly by amendments in the classification of mail matter and the curtailment of abuses of the second class mailing privilege the average increase in the volume of mail matter for the period beginning with 1902 and ending june 1905 that portion for 1905 being estimated is 40 47 per cent as compared with 25 46 per cent for the period immediately preceding and 15 92 for the four year period immediately preceding that our consular system needs improvement salaries should be substituted for fees and the proper classification grading and transfer of consular officers should be provided i am not prepared to say that a competitive system of examinations for appointment would work well but by law it should be provided that consuls should be familiar according to places for which they apply with the french german or spanish languages and should possess acquaintance with the resources of the united states the collection of objects of art contemplated in section 5586 of the revised statutes should be designated and established as a national gallery of art and the smithsonian institution should be authorized to accept any additions to said collection that may be received by gift bequest or devise it is desirable to enact a proper national quarantine law it is most undesirable that a state should on its own initiative enforce quarantine regulations which are in effect a restriction upon interstate and international commerce the question should properly be assumed by the government alone the surgeon general of the national public health and marine hospital service has repeatedly and convincingly set forth the need for such legislation i call your attention to the great extravagance in printing and binding government publications and especially to the fact that altogether too many of these publications are printed there is a constant tendency to increase their number and their volume it is an understatement to say that no appreciable harm would be caused by and substantial benefit would accrue from decreasing the amount of printing now done by at least one half probably the great majority of the government reports and the like now printed are never read at all and furthermore the printing of much of the material contained in many of the remaining ones serves no useful purpose whatever the attention of the congress should be especially given to the currency question and that the standing committees on the matter in the two houses charged with the duty take up the matter of our currency and see whether it is not possible to secure an agreement in the business world for bettering the system the committees should consider the question of the retirement of the greenbacks and the problem of securing in our currency such elasticity as is consistent with safety every silver dollar should be made by law redeemable in gold at the option of the holder i especially commend to your immediate attention the encouragement of our merchant marine by appropriate legislation the growing importance of the orient as a field for american exports drew from my predecessor president mckinley an urgent request for its special consideration by the congress in his message of 1898 he stated in this relation as showing the peculiar volume and value of our trade with china and the peculiarly favorable conditions which exist for their expansion in the normal course of trade i refer to the communication addressed to the speaker of the house of representatives by the secretary of the treasury on the 14th of last june with its accompanying letter of the secretary of state recommending an appropriation for a commission to study the industrial and commercial conditions in the chinese empire and to report as to the opportunities for and the obstacles to the enlargement of markets in china for the raw products and manufactures of the united states action was not taken thereon during the last session i cordially urge that the recommendation receive at your hands the consideration which its importance and timeliness merit in his annual message of 1889 he again called attention to this recommendation quoting it and stated further i now renew this recommendation as the importance of the subject has steadily grown since it was first submitted to you and no time should be lost in studying for ourselves the resources of this great field for american trade and enterprise the importance of securing proper information and data with a view to the enlargement of our trade with asia is undiminished our consular representatives in china have strongly urged a place for permanent display of american products in some prominent trade center of that empire under government control and management as an effective means of advancing our export trade therein i call the attention of the congress to the desirability of carrying out these suggestions in dealing with the questions of immigration and naturalization it is indispensable to keep certain facts ever before the minds of those who share in enacting the laws first and foremost let us remember that the question of being a good american has nothing whatever to do with a man s birthplace any more than it has to do with his creed in every generation from the time this government was founded men of foreign birth have stood in the very foremost rank of good citizenship and that not merely in one but in every field of american activity while to try to draw a distinction between the man whose parents came to this country and the man whose ancestors came to it several generations back is a mere absurdity good americanism is a matter of heart of conscience of lofty aspiration of sound common sense but not of birthplace or of creed the medal of honor the highest prize to be won by those who serve in the army and the navy of the united states decorates men born here and it also decorates men born in great britain and ireland in germany in scandinavia in france and doubtless in other countries also in the field of statesmanship in the field of business in the field of philanthropic endeavor it is equally true that among the men of whom we are most proud as americans no distinction whatever can be drawn between those who themselves or whose parents came over in sailing ship or steamer from across the water and those whose ancestors stepped ashore into the wooded wilderness at plymouth or at the mouth of the hudson the delaware or the james nearly three centuries ago no fellow citizen of ours is entitled to any peculiar regard because of the way in which he worships his maker or because of the birthplace of himself or his parents nor should he be in any way discriminated against therefor each must stand on his worth as a man and each is entitled to be judged solely thereby there is no danger of having too many immigrants of the right kind it makes no difference from what country they come if they are sound in body and in mind and above all if they are of good character so that we can rest assured that their children and grandchildren will be worthy fellow citizens of our children and grandchildren then we should welcome them with cordial hospitality but the citizenship of this country should not be debased it is vital that we should keep high the standard of well being among our wage workers and therefore we should not admit masses of men whose standards of living and whose personal customs and habits are such that they tend to lower the level of the american wage worker and above all we should not admit any man of an unworthy type any man concerning whom we can say that he will himself be a bad citizen or that his children and grandchildren will detract from instead of adding to the sum of the good citizenship of the country similarly we should take the greatest care about naturalization fraudulent naturalization the naturalization of improper persons is a curse to our government and it is the affair of every honest voter wherever born to see that no fraudulent voting is allowed that no fraud in connection with naturalization is permitted in the past year the cases of false fraudulent and improper naturalization of aliens coming to the attention of the executive branches of the government have increased to an alarming degree extensive sales of forged certificates of naturalization have been discovered as well as many cases of naturalization secured by perjury and fraud and in addition instances have accumulated showing that many courts issue certificates of naturalization carelessly and upon insufficient evidence under the constitution it is in the power of the congress to establish a uniform rule of naturalization and numerous laws have from time to time been enacted for that purpose which have been supplemented in a few states by state laws having special application the federal statutes permit naturalization by any court of record in the united states having common law jurisdiction and a seal and clerk except the police court of the district of columbia and nearly all these courts exercise this important function it results that where so many courts of such varying grades have jurisdiction there is lack of uniformity in the rules applied in conferring naturalization some courts are strict and others lax an alien who may secure naturalization in one place might be denied it in another and the intent of the constitutional provision is in fact defeated furthermore the certificates of naturalization issued by the courts differ widely in wording and appearance and when they are brought into use in foreign countries are frequently subject to suspicion there should be a comprehensive revision of the naturalization laws the courts having power to naturalize should be definitely named by national authority the testimony upon which naturalization may be conferred should be definitely prescribed publication of impending naturalization applications should be required in advance of their hearing in court the form and wording of all certificates issued should be uniform throughout the country and the courts should be required to make returns to the secretary of state at stated periods of all naturalizations conferred not only are the laws relating to naturalization now defective but those relating to citizenship of the united states ought also to be made the subject of scientific inquiry with a view to probable further legislation by what acts expatriation may be assumed to have been accomplished how long an american citizen may reside abroad and receive the protection of our passport whether any degree of protection should be extended to one who has made the declaration of intention to become a citizen of the united states but has not secured naturalization are questions of serious import involving personal rights and often producing friction between this government and foreign governments yet upon these question our laws are silent i recommend that an examination be made into the subjects of citizenship expatriation and protection of americans abroad with a view to appropriate legislation the power of the government to protect the integrity of the elections of its own officials is inherent and has been recognized and affirmed by repeated declarations of the supreme court there is no enemy of free government more dangerous and none so insidious as the corruption of the electorate no one defends or excuses corruption and it would seem to follow that none would oppose vigorous measures to eradicate it i recommend the enactment of a law directed against bribery and corruption in federal elections the details of such a law may be safely left to the wise discretion of the congress but it should go as far as under the constitution it is possible to go and should include severe penalties against him who gives or receives a bribe intended to influence his act or opinion as an elector and provisions for the publication not only of the expenditures for nominations and elections of all candidates but also of all contributions received and expenditures made by political committees no subject is better worthy the attention of the congress than that portion of the report of the attorney general dealing with the long delays and the great obstruction to justice experienced in the cases of beavers green and gaynor and benson were these isolated and special cases i should not call your attention to them but the difficulties encountered as regards these men who have been indicted for criminal practices are not exceptional they are precisely similar in kind to what occurs again and again in the case of criminals who have sufficient means to enable them to take advantage of a system of procedure which has grown up in the federal courts and which amounts in effect to making the law easy of enforcement against the man who has no money and difficult of enforcement even to the point of sometimes securing immunity as regards the man who has money in criminal cases the writ of the united states should run throughout its borders the wheels of justice should not be clogged as they have been clogged in the cases above mentioned where it has proved absolutely impossible to bring the accused to the place appointed by the constitution for his trial of recent years there has been grave and increasing complaint of the difficulty of bringing to justice those criminals whose criminality instead of being against one person in the republic is against all persons in the republic because it is against the republic itself under any circumstance and from the very nature of the case it is often exceedingly difficult to secure proper punishment of those who have been guilty of wrongdoing against the government by the time the offender can be brought into court the popular wrath against him has generally subsided and there is in most instances very slight danger indeed of any prejudice existing in the minds of the jury against him at present the interests of the innocent man are amply safeguarded but the interests of the government that is the interests of honest administration that is the interests of the people are not recognized as they should be no subject better warrants the attention of the congress indeed no subject better warrants the attention of the bench and the bar throughout the united states alaska like all our territorial acquisitions has proved resourceful beyond the expectations of those who made the purchase it has become the home of many hardy industrious and thrifty american citizens towns of a permanent character have been built the extent of its wealth in minerals timber fisheries and agriculture while great is probably not comprehended yet in any just measure by our people we do know however that from a very small beginning its products have grown until they are a steady and material contribution to the wealth of the nation owing to the immensity of alaska and its location in the far north it is a difficult matter to provide many things essential to its growth and to the happiness and comfort of its people by private enterprise alone it should therefore receive reasonable aid from the government the government has already done excellent work for alaska in laying cables and building telegraph lines this work has been done in the most economical and efficient way by the signal corps of the army in some respects it has outgrown its present laws while in others those laws have been found to be inadequate in order to obtain information upon which i could rely i caused an official of the department of justice in whose judgment i have confidence to visit alaska during the past summer for the purpose of ascertaining how government is administered there and what legislation is actually needed at present a statement of the conditions found to exist together with some recommendations and the reasons therefor in which i strongly concur will be found in the annual report of the attorney general in some instances i feel that the legislation suggested is so imperatively needed that i am moved briefly to emphasize the attorney general s proposals under the code of alaska as it now stands many purely administrative powers and duties including by far the most important devolve upon the district judges or upon the clerks of the district court acting under the direction of the judges while the governor upon whom these powers and duties should logically fall has nothing specific to do except to make annual reports issue thanksgiving day proclamations and appoint indian policemen and notaries public i believe it essential to good government in alaska and therefore recommend that the congress divest the district judges and the clerks of their courts of the administrative or executive functions that they now exercise and cast them upon the governor this would not be an innovation it would simply conform the government of alaska to fundamental principles making the governorship a real instead of a merely nominal office and leaving the judges free to give their entire attention to their judicial duties and at the same time removing them from a great deal of the strife that now embarrasses the judicial office in alaska i also recommend that the salaries of the district judges and district attorneys in alaska be increased so as to make them equal to those received by corresponding officers in the united states after deducting the difference in the cost of living that the district attorneys should be prohibited from engaging in private practice that united states commissioners be appointed by the governor of the territory instead of by the district judges and that a fixed salary be provided for them to take the place of the discredited fee system which should be abolished in all offices that a mounted constabulary be created to police the territory outside the limits of incorporated towns a vast section now wholly without police protection and that some provision be made to at least lessen the oppressive delays and costs that now attend the prosecution of appeals from the district court of alaska there should be a division of the existing judicial districts and an increase in the number of judges alaska should have a delegate in the congress where possible the congress should aid in the construction of needed wagon roads additional light houses should be provided in my judgment it is especially important to aid in such manner as seems just and feasible in the construction of a trunk line of railway to connect the gulf of alaska with the yukon river through american territory this would be most beneficial to the development of the resources of the territory and to the comfort and welfare of its people salmon hatcheries should be established in many different streams so as to secure the preservation of this valuable food fish salmon fisheries and canneries should be prohibited on certain of the rivers where the mass of those indians dwell who live almost exclusively on fish the alaskan natives are kindly intelligent anxious to learn and willing to work those who have come under the influence of civilization even for a limited period have proved their capability of becoming self supporting self respecting citizens and ask only for the just enforcement of law and intelligent instruction and supervision others living in more remote regions primitive simple hunters and fisher folk who know only the life of the woods and the waters are daily being confronted with twentieth century civilization with all of its complexities their country is being overrun by strangers the game slaughtered and driven away the streams depleted of fish and hitherto unknown and fatal diseases brought to them all of which combine to produce a state of abject poverty and want which must result in their extinction action in their interest is demanded by every consideration of justice and humanity the needs of these people are the abolition of the present fee system whereby the native is degraded imposed upon and taught the injustice of law the establishment of hospitals at central points so that contagious diseases that are brought to them continually by incoming whites may be localized and not allowed to become epidemic to spread death and destitution over great areas the development of the educational system in the form of practical training in such industries as will assure the indians self support under the changed conditions in which they will have to live the duties of the office of the governor should be extended to include the supervision of indian affairs with necessary assistants in different districts he should be provided with the means and the power to protect and advise the native people to furnish medical treatment in time of epidemics and to extend material relief in periods of famine and extreme destitution the alaskan natives should be given the right to acquire hold and dispose of property upon the same conditions as given other inhabitants and the privilege of citizenship should be given to such as may be able to meet certain definite requirements in hawaii congress should give the governor power to remove all the officials appointed under him the harbor of honolulu should be dredged the marine hospital service should be empowered to study leprosy in the islands i ask special consideration for the report and recommendation of the governor of porto rico in treating of our foreign policy and of the attitude that this great nation should assume in the world at large it is absolutely necessary to consider the army and the navy and the congress through which the thought of the nation finds its expression should keep ever vividly in mind the fundamental fact that it is impossible to treat our foreign policy whether this policy takes shape in the effort to secure justice for others or justice for ourselves save as conditioned upon the attitude we are willing to take toward our army and especially toward our navy it is not merely unwise it is contemptible for a nation as for an individual to use high sounding language to proclaim its purposes or to take positions which are ridiculous if unsupported by potential force and then to refuse to provide this force if there is no intention of providing and of keeping the force necessary to back up a strong attitude then it is far better not to assume such an attitude the steady aim of this nation as of all enlightened nations should be to strive to bring ever nearer the day when there shall prevail throughout the world the peace of justice there are kinds of peace which are highly undesirable which are in the long run as destructive as any war tyrants and oppressors have many times made a wilderness and called it peace many times peoples who were slothful or timid or shortsighted who had been enervated by ease or by luxury or misled by false teachings have shrunk in unmanly fashion from doing duty that was stern and that needed self sacrifice and have sought to hide from their own minds their shortcomings their ignoble motives by calling them love of peace the peace of tyrannous terror the peace of craven weakness the peace of injustice all these should be shunned as we shun unrighteous war the goal to set before us as a nation the goal which should be set before all mankind is the attainment of the peace of justice of the peace which comes when each nation is not merely safe guarded in its own rights but scrupulously recognizes and performs its duty toward others generally peace tells for righteousness but if there is conflict between the two then our fealty is due first to the cause of righteousness unrighteous wars are common and unrighteous peace is rare but both should be shunned the right of freedom and the responsibility for the exercise of that right can not be divorced one of our great poets has well and finely said that freedom is not a gift that tarries long in the hands of cowards neither does it tarry long in the hands of those too slothful too dishonest or too unintelligent to exercise it the eternal vigilance which is the price of liberty must be exercised sometimes to guard against outside foes although of course far more often to guard against our own selfish or thoughtless shortcomings if these self evident truths are kept before us and only if they are so kept before us we shall have a clear idea of what our foreign policy in its larger aspects should be it is our duty to remember that a nation has no more right to do injustice to another nation strong or weak than an individual has to do injustice to another individual that the same moral law applies in one case as in the other but we must also remember that it is as much the duty of the nation to guard its own rights and its own interests as it is the duty of the individual so to do within the nation the individual has now delegated this right to the state that is to the representative of all the individuals and it is a maxim of the law that for every wrong there is a remedy but in international law we have not advanced by any means as far as we have advanced in municipal law there is as yet no judicial way of enforcing a right in international law when one nation wrongs another or wrongs many others there is no tribunal before which the wrongdoer can be brought either it is necessary supinely to acquiesce in the wrong and thus put a premium upon brutality and aggression or else it is necessary for the aggrieved nation valiantly to stand up for its rights until some method is devised by which there shall be a degree of international control over offending nations it would be a wicked thing for the most civilized powers for those with most sense of international obligations and with keenest and most generous appreciation of the difference between right and wrong to disarm if the great civilized nations of the present day should completely disarm the result would mean an immediate recrudescence of barbarism in one form or another under any circumstances a sufficient armament would have to be kept up to serve the purposes of international police and until international cohesion and the sense of international duties and rights are far more advanced than at present a nation desirous both of securing respect for itself and of doing good to others must have a force adequate for the work which it feels is allotted to it as its part of the general world duty therefore it follows that a self respecting just and far seeing nation should on the one hand endeavor by every means to aid in the development of the various movements which tend to provide substitutes for war which tend to render nations in their actions toward one another and indeed toward their own peoples more responsive to the general sentiment of humane and civilized mankind and on the other hand that it should keep prepared while scrupulously avoiding wrongdoing itself to repel any wrong and in exceptional cases to take action which in a more advanced stage of international relations would come under the head of the exercise of the international police a great free people owes it to itself and to all mankind not to sink into helplessness before the powers of evil we are in every way endeavoring to help on with cordial good will every movement which will tend to bring us into more friendly relations with the rest of mankind in pursuance of this policy i shall shortly lay before the senate treaties of arbitration with all powers which are willing to enter into these treaties with us it is not possible at this period of the world s development to agree to arbitrate all matters but there are many matters of possible difference between us and other nations which can be thus arbitrated furthermore at the request of the interparliamentary union an eminent body composed of practical statesmen from all countries i have asked the powers to join with this government in a second hague conference at which it is hoped that the work already so happily begun at the hague may be carried some steps further toward completion this carries out the desire expressed by the first hague conference itself it is not true that the united states feels any land hunger or entertains any projects as regards the other nations of the western hemisphere save such as are for their welfare all that this country desires is to see the neighboring countries stable orderly and prosperous any country whose people conduct themselves well can count upon our hearty friendship if a nation shows that it knows how to act with reasonable efficiency and decency in social and political matters if it keeps order and pays its obligations it need fear no interference from the united states chronic wrongdoing or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society may in america as elsewhere ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation and in the western hemisphere the adherence of the united states to the monroe doctrine may force the united states however reluctantly in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence to the exercise of an international police power if every country washed by the caribbean sea would show the progress in stable and just civilization which with the aid of the platt amendment cuba has shown since our troops left the island and which so many of the republics in both americas are constantly and brilliantly showing all question of interference by this nation with their affairs would be at an end our interests and those of our southern neighbors are in reality identical they have great natural riches and if within their borders the reign of law and justice obtains prosperity is sure to come to them while they thus obey the primary laws of civilized society they may rest assured that they will be treated by us in a spirit of cordial and helpful sympathy we would interfere with them only in the last resort and then only if it became evident that their inability or unwillingness to do justice at home and abroad had violated the rights of the united states or had invited foreign aggression to the detriment of the entire body of american nations it is a mere truism to say that every nation whether in america or anywhere else which desires to maintain its freedom its independence must ultimately realize that the right of such independence can not be separated from the responsibility of making good use of it in asserting the monroe doctrine in taking such steps as we have taken in regard to cuba venezuela and panama and in endeavoring to circumscribe the theater of war in the far east and to secure the open door in china we have acted in our own interest as well as in the interest of humanity at large there are however cases in which while our own interests are not greatly involved strong appeal is made to our sympathies ordinarily it is very much wiser and more useful for us to concern ourselves with striving for our own moral and material betterment here at home than to concern ourselves with trying to better the condition of things in other nations we have plenty of sins of our own to war against and under ordinary circumstances we can do more for the general uplifting of humanity by striving with heart and soul to put a stop to civic corruption to brutal lawlessness and violent race prejudices here at home than by passing resolutions about wrongdoing elsewhere nevertheless there are occasional crimes committed on so vast a scale and of such peculiar horror as to make us doubt whether it is not our manifest duty to endeavor at least to show our disapproval of the deed and our sympathy with those who have suffered by it the cases must be extreme in which such a course is justifiable there must be no effort made to remove the mote from our brother s eye if we refuse to remove the beam from our own but in extreme cases action may be justifiable and proper what form the action shall take must depend upon the circumstances of the case that is upon the degree of the atrocity and upon our power to remedy it the cases in which we could interfere by force of arms as we interfered to put a stop to intolerable conditions in cuba are necessarily very few yet it is not to be expected that a people like ours which in spite of certain very obvious shortcomings nevertheless as a whole shows by its consistent practice its belief in the principles of civil and religious liberty and of orderly freedom a people among whom even the worst crime like the crime of lynching is never more than sporadic so that individuals and not classes are molested in their fundamental rights it is inevitable that such a nation should desire eagerly to give expression to its horror on an occasion like that of the massacre of the jews in kishenef or when it witnesses such systematic and long extended cruelty and oppression as the cruelty and oppression of which the armenians have been the victims and which have won for them the indignant pity of the civilized world even where it is not possible to secure in other nations the observance of the principles which we accept as axiomatic it is necessary for us firmly to insist upon the rights of our own citizens without regard to their creed or race without regard to whether they were born here or born abroad it has proved very difficult to secure from russia the right for our jewish fellow citizens to receive passports and travel through russian territory such conduct is not only unjust and irritating toward us but it is difficult to see its wisdom from russia s standpoint no conceivable good is accomplished by it if an american jew or an american christian misbehaves himself in russia he can at once be driven out but the ordinary american jew like the ordinary american christian would behave just about as he behaves here that is behave as any good citizen ought to behave and where this is the case it is a wrong against which we are entitled to protest to refuse him his passport without regard to his conduct and character merely on racial and religious grounds in turkey our difficulties arise less from the way in which our citizens are sometimes treated than from the indignation inevitably excited in seeing such fearful misrule as has been witnessed both in armenia and macedonia the strong arm of the government in enforcing respect for its just rights in international matters is the navy of the united states i most earnestly recommend that there be no halt in the work of upbuilding the american navy there is no more patriotic duty before us a people than to keep the navy adequate to the needs of this country s position we have undertaken to build the isthmian canal we have undertaken to secure for ourselves our just share in the trade of the orient we have undertaken to protect our citizens from proper treatment in foreign lands we continue steadily to insist on the application of the monroe doctrine to the western hemisphere unless our attitude in these and all similar matters is to be a mere boastful sham we can not afford to abandon our naval programme our voice is now potent for peace and is so potent because we are not afraid of war but our protestations upon behalf of peace would neither receive nor deserve the slightest attention if we were impotent to make them good the war which now unfortunately rages in the far east has emphasized in striking fashion the new possibilities of naval warfare the lessons taught are both strategic and tactical and are political as well as military the experiences of the war have shown in conclusive fashion that while sea going and sea keeping torpedo destroyers are indispensable and fast lightly armed and armored cruisers very useful yet that the main reliance the main standby in any navy worthy the name must be the great battle ships heavily armored and heavily gunned not a russian or japanese battle ship has been sunk by a torpedo boat or by gunfire while among the less protected ships cruiser after cruiser has been destroyed whenever the hostile squadrons have gotten within range of one another s weapons there will always be a large field of usefulness for cruisers especially of the more formidable type we need to increase the number of torpedo boat destroyers paying less heed to their having a knot or two extra speed than to their capacity to keep the seas for weeks and if necessary for months at a time it is wise to build submarine torpedo boats as under certain circumstances they might be very useful but most of all we need to continue building our fleet of battle ships or ships so powerfully armed that they can inflict the maximum of damage upon our opponents and so well protected that they can suffer a severe hammering in return without fatal impairment of their ability to fight and maneuver of course ample means must be provided for enabling the personnel of the navy to be brought to the highest point of efficiency our great fighting ships and torpedo boats must be ceaselessly trained and maneuvered in squadrons the officers and men can only learn their trade thoroughly by ceaseless practice on the high seas in the event of war it would be far better to have no ships at all than to have ships of a poor and ineffective type or ships which however good were yet manned by untrained and unskillful crews the best officers and men in a poor ship could do nothing against fairly good opponents and on the other hand a modern war ship is useless unless the officers and men aboard her have become adepts in their duties the marksmanship in our navy has improved in an extraordinary degree during the last three years and on the whole the types of our battleships are improving but much remains to be done sooner or later we shall have to provide for some method by which there will be promotions for merit as well as for seniority or else retirement all those who after a certain age have not advanced beyond a certain grade while no effort must be spared to make the service attractive to the enlisted men in order that they may be kept as long as possible in it reservation public schools should be provided wherever there are navy yards within the last three years the united states has set an example in disarmament where disarmament was proper by law our army is fixed at a maximum of one hundred thousand and a minimum of sixty thousand men when there was insurrection in the philippines we kept the army at the maximum peace came in the philippines and now our army has been reduced to the minimum at which it is possible to keep it with due regard to its efficiency the guns now mounted require twenty eight thousand men if the coast fortifications are to be adequately manned relatively to the nation it is not now so large as the police force of new york or chicago relatively to the population of either city we need more officers there are not enough to perform the regular army work it is very important that the officers of the army should be accustomed to handle their men in masses as it is also important that the national guard of the several states should be accustomed to actual field maneuvering especially in connection with the regulars for this reason we are to be congratulated upon the success of the field maneuvers at manassas last fall maneuvers in which a larger number of regulars and national guard took part than was ever before assembled together in time of peace no other civilized nation has relatively to its population such a diminutive army as ours and while the army is so small we are not to be excused if we fail to keep it at a very high grade of proficiency it must be incessantly practiced the standard for the enlisted men should be kept very high while at the same time the service should be made as attractive as possible and the standard for the officers should be kept even higher which as regards the upper ranks can best be done by introducing some system of selection and rejection into the promotions we should be able in the event of some sudden emergency to put into the field one first class army corps which should be as a whole at least the equal of any body of troops of like number belonging to any other nation great progress has been made in protecting our coasts by adequate fortifications with sufficient guns we should however pay much more heed than at present to the development of an extensive system of floating mines for use in all our more important harbors these mines have been proved to be a most formidable safeguard against hostile fleets i earnestly call the attention of the congress to the need of amending the existing law relating to the award of congressional medals of honor in the navy so as to provide that they may be awarded to commissioned officers and warrant officers as well as to enlisted men these justly prized medals are given in the army alike to the officers and the enlisted men and it is most unjust that the commissioned officers and warrant officers of the navy should not in this respect have the same rights as their brethren in the army and as the enlisted men of the navy in the philippine islands there has been during the past year a continuation of the steady progress which has obtained ever since our troops definitely got the upper hand of the insurgents the philippine people or to speak more accurately the many tribes and even races sundered from one another more or less sharply who go to make up the people of the philippine islands contain many elements of good and some elements which we have a right to hope stand for progress at present they are utterly incapable of existing in independence at all or of building up a civilization of their own i firmly believe that we can help them to rise higher and higher in the scale of civilization and of capacity for self government and i most earnestly hope that in the end they will be able to stand if not entirely alone yet in some such relation to the united states as cuba now stands this end is not yet in sight and it may be indefinitely postponed if our people are foolish enough to turn the attention of the filipinos away from the problems of achieving moral and material prosperity of working for a stable orderly and just government and toward foolish and dangerous intrigues for a complete independence for which they are as yet totally unfit on the other hand our people must keep steadily before their minds the fact that the justification for our stay in the philippines must ultimately rest chiefly upon the good we are able to do in the islands i do not overlook the fact that in the development of our interests in the pacific ocean and along its coasts the philippines have played and will play an important part and that our interests have been served in more than one way by the possession of the islands but our chief reason for continuing to hold them must be that we ought in good faith to try to do our share of the world s work and this particular piece of work has been imposed upon us by the results of the war with spain the problem presented to us in the philippine islands is akin to but not exactly like the problems presented to the other great civilized powers which have possessions in the orient there are points of resemblance in our work to the work which is being done by the british in india and egypt by the french in algiers by the dutch in java by the russians in turkestan by the japanese in formosa but more distinctly than any of these powers we are endeavoring to develop the natives themselves so that they shall take an ever increasing share in their own government and as far as is prudent we are already admitting their representatives to a governmental equality with our own there are commissioners judges and governors in the islands who are filipinos and who have exactly the same share in the government of the islands as have their colleagues who are americans while in the lower ranks of course the great majority of the public servants are filipinos within two years we shall be trying the experiment of an elective lower house in the philippine legislature it may be that the filipinos will misuse this legislature and they certainly will misuse it if they are misled by foolish persons here at home into starting an agitation for their own independence or into any factious or improper action in such case they will do themselves no good and will stop for the time being all further effort to advance them and give them a greater share in their own government but if they act with wisdom and self restraint if they show that they are capable of electing a legislature which in its turn is capable of taking a sane and efficient part in the actual work of government they can rest assured that a full and increasing measure of recognition will be given them above all they should remember that their prime needs are moral and industrial not political it is a good thing to try the experiment of giving them a legislature but it is a far better thing to give them schools good roads railroads which will enable them to get their products to market honest courts an honest and efficient constabulary and all that tends to produce order peace fair dealing as between man and man and habits of intelligent industry and thrift if they are safeguarded against oppression and if their real wants material and spiritual are studied intelligently and in a spirit of friendly sympathy much more good will be done them than by any effort to give them political power though this effort may in its own proper time and place be proper enough meanwhile our own people should remember that there is need for the highest standard of conduct among the americans sent to the philippine islands not only among the public servants but among the private individuals who go to them it is because i feel this so deeply that in the administration of these islands i have positively refused to permit any discrimination whatsoever for political reasons and have insisted that in choosing the public servants consideration should be paid solely to the worth of the men chosen and to the needs of the islands there is no higher body of men in our public service than we have in the philippine islands under governor wright and his associates so far as possible these men should be given a free hand and their suggestions should receive the hearty backing both of the executive and of the congress there is need of a vigilant and disinterested support of our public servants in the philippines by good citizens here in the united states unfortunately hitherto those of our people here at home who have specially claimed to be the champions of the filipinos have in reality been their worst enemies this will continue to be the case as long as they strive to make the filipinos independent and stop all industrial development of the islands by crying out against the laws which would bring it on the ground that capitalists must not exploit the islands such proceedings are not only unwise but are most harmful to the filipinos who do not need independence at all but who do need good laws good public servants and the industrial development that can only come if the investment of american and foreign capital in the islands is favored in all legitimate ways every measure taken concerning the islands should be taken primarily with a view to their advantage we should certainly give them lower tariff rates on their exports to the united states if this is not done it will be a wrong to extend our shipping laws to them i earnestly hope for the immediate enactment into law of the legislation now pending to encourage american capital to seek investment in the islands in railroads in factories in plantations and in lumbering and mining

well thank you very much for that warm welcome governor baliles congressman slaughter and my very special thanks too to senator warner and president o neil for suggesting this invitation and you know as president i have certain privileges so i checked with president o neil and i m delighted to announce that starting monday night you all have 4 weeks off but here at uva we are surrounded with memories of thomas jefferson one of my staff mentioned that thomas jefferson s favorite recreation was horseback riding and i said he was a wise man laughter and another member of the staff said that thomas jefferson thought the white house was a noble edifice and i said he was a man of refined taste laughter and a third staff member noted that after retiring as president thomas jefferson in his seventies didn t sit back and rest but founded the university of virginia and i said there s always an overachiever which makes it hard for the rest of us but no speaker can come to these grounds or see the lawn without appreciating the symmetry not just of the architecture but of the mind that created it the man to whom that mind belonged is known to you as mr jefferson and i think the familiarity of that term is justified his influence here is everywhere and yet while those of you at uva are fortunate to have before you physical reminders of the power of your founder s intellect and imagination it should be remembered that all you do here indeed all of higher education in america bears signs too of his transforming genius the pursuit of science the study of the great works the value of free inquiry in short the very idea of the living the life of the mind yes these formative and abiding principles of higher education in america had their first and firmest advocate and their greatest embodiment in a tall fair headed friendly man who watched this university take form from the mountainside where he lived the university whose founding he called a crowning achievement to a long and well spent life well you re not alone in feeling his presence presidents know about this too you ve heard many times that during the first year of his presidency john f kennedy said to a group of nobel laureates in the state dining room of the white house that there had not been such a collection of talent in that place since jefferson dined there alone laughter and directly down the lawn and across the ellipse from the white house are those ordered classic lines of the jefferson memorial and the eyes of the 19 foot statue that gaze directly into the white house a reminder to any of us who might occupy that mansion of the quality of mind and generosity of heart that once abided there and has been so rarely seen there again but it s not just students and presidents it is every american indeed every human life ever touched by the daring idea of self government that mr jefferson has influenced yes mr jefferson was obliged to admit all previous attempts at popular government had proven themselves failures but he believed that here on this continent as one of his commentators put it here was virgin soil an abundance of land no degrading poverty a brave and intelligent people which had just vindicated its title to independence after a long struggle with the mightiest of european powers well here was another chance an opportunity for enlightened government government based on the principles of reason and tolerance government that left to the people the fruits of their labor and the pursuit of their own definition of happiness in the form of commerce or education or religion and so it s no wonder he asked that his epitaph read simply here was born buried thomas jefferson author of the declaration of american independence of the statute of virginia for religious freedom and father of the university of virginia well as that epitaph shows for all his learning and bookishness mr jefferson was a practical man a man who made things things like a university a state government a national government in founding and sustaining these institutions he wanted them to be based on the same symmetry the same balance of mind and faith in human creativity evidenced in the lawn he had known personal tragedy he knew how disorderly a place the world could be indeed as a leader of a rebellion he was himself an architect if you will of disorder but he also believed that man had received from god a precious gift of enlightenment the gift of reason a gift that could extract from the chaos of life meaning truth order just as we see in his architecture the balancing of circular with linear of rotunda with pillar we see in his works of government the same disposition toward balance toward symmetry and harmony he knew successful self government meant bringing together disparate interests and concerns balancing for example on the one hand the legitimate duties of government the maintenance of domestic order and protection from foreign menace with government s tendency to preempt its citizens rights take the fruits of their labors and reduce them ultimately to servitude so he knew that governing meant balance harmony and he knew from personal experience the danger posed to such harmony by the voices of unreason special privilege partisanship or intolerance and i do mean personal experience you see despite all of george washington s warnings about the divisiveness of the partisan spirit federalists and republicans were constantly at each other in those days the federalists of the northeast had held power for a long time and were not anxious to relinquish it years later a new york congressman honored the good old days when as he put it a federalist could knock a republican down in the streets of new york and not be questioned about it the federalists referred to mr jefferson as and here i quote a mean spirited low lived fellow raised wholly on hotcake made of coarse ground southern corn bacon and hominy with an occasional fricasseed bullfrog laughter well by the way was the 1800 equivalent of what i believe is known here at uva as a gus burger laughter and an editorial in the federalist connecticut courant also announced that as soon as mr jefferson was elected murder robbery rape and adultery and incest will be openly taught and practiced laughter well that was politics in 1800 so you see not all that much has changed laughter actually i ve taken a moment for these brief reflections on thomas jefferson and his time precisely because there are such clear parallels to our own we too have seen a new populism in america not at all unlike that of jefferson s time we ve seen the growth of a jefferson like populism that rejects the burden placed on the people by excessive regulation and taxation that rejects the notion that judgeships should be used to further privately held beliefs not yet approved by the people and finally rejects too the notion that foreign policy must reflect only the rarefied concerns of washington rather than the common sense of a people who can frequently see far more plainly dangers to their freedom and to our national well being it is this latter point that brings me to the university of virginia today there has been much change in the last 8 years in our foreign relations and this september when i spoke to the united nations i summarized much of the progress we ve seen in such matters as the human rights agenda arms reduction and resolving those regional conflicts that might lead to wider war i will not recite all of this here again today but i do want you to know i found in the delegates afterward a warmth that i had not seen before let me assure you not due to any eloquence on my part but just a simple perception on their part that there is a chance for an opening a new course in human events i think i detected a sense of excitement even perhaps like that felt by those who lived in jefferson s time a sense of new possibilities for the idea of popular government only this time it s not just a single nation at issue it is the whole world where popular government might flourish and prosper only a few years ago this would have seemed the most outlandish and dreamiest of prospects but consider for just a moment the striving for democracy that we have seen in places like the philippines burma korea chile poland south africa even places like china and the soviet union one of the great unnoticed and yet most startling developments of this decade is this more of the world s populace is today living in relative freedom than ever before in history more and more nations are turning to freely elected democratic governments the statistics themselves are compelling according to one organization freedom house in the past 15 years the number of countries called not free declined from 71 to 50 and the countries classified as free or partly free increased from 92 to 117 when you consider that according to the freedom house count 70 percent of those not living in freedom are in china and the soviet union and even in those nations as i say we see glimpses of hope the picture is even brighter the most dramatic movement of all has taken place more than 90 percent of the people are now living in countries that are democratic or headed in that direction this democratic revolution has been accompanied by a change in economic thinking comparable to the newtonian revolution in physics and that is no accident free market economies have worked miracles in several nations of east asia a u n general assembly special session on africa has called for more market oriented structural reform in that region in europe the tide is against state ownership of property and even in china and the soviet union the theoretical underpinnings of socialist economics are being reexamined in this atmosphere we ve continued to emphasize prudent but deepening development of economic ties which are critical to our economic health in the conduct of our foreign policy in our own hemisphere we re about to implement an historic free trade agreement between the united states and canada that could well serve as a model for the world these democratic and free market revolutions are really the same revolution they are based on the vital nexus between economic and political freedom and on the jeffersonian idea that freedom is indivisible that government s attempts to encroach on that freedom whether it be through political restrictions on the rights of assembly speech or publication or economic repression through high taxation and excessive bureaucracy have been the principal institutional barrier to human progress but if this remarkable revolution has not been obvious to many certainly one other eye opening change has been self evident consider for just a moment the sights we ve seen this year an american president with his soviet counterpart strolling through red square and talking to passers by about war and peace an american president there in the lenin hills of moscow speaking to the students of moscow state university young people like yourselves about the wonder and splendor of human freedom an american president only last week with a future american president and the president of the soviet union standing in new york harbor looking up at lady liberty hearing again the prayer on the lips of all those millions who once passed that way in hope of a better life and future a prayer of peace and freedom for all humanity and yes even this week in the devastation of armenia americans and russians making common cause as we once made common cause against another terrible enemy 44 years ago but it s not the visuals and the sound bites that matter behind all of this is a record of diplomatic movement and accomplishment one of those visuals you ve seen in the last year is the signing of accords between mr gorbachev and me and the destruction of american and soviet missiles it was more than just good television more than just action news the inf treaty is the first accord in history to eliminate an entire class of u s and soviet nuclear missiles and the start treaty which deals with far larger arsenals of long range or what the experts call strategic weapons calls for 50 percent reductions in such weapons in geneva where the portions of the draft treaty disputed by one side or the other are put in brackets we are slowly seeing those brackets disappear so the treaty is coming closer and so too there s progress on nuclear testing agreements and chemical weapons and we re about to begin new negotiations on the conventional balance in europe mr gorbachev s recent announcement at the u n about troop reductions was most welcome and appreciated but it s important to remember this is a part of and the result of a larger disarmament process set in motion several years ago another area where the achievements are visible is that of regional conflicts in afghanistan we ve seen a settlement leading towards soviet withdrawal in cambodia the first steps have been taken toward withdrawal of vietnamese troops in brazzaville just this tuesday an american mediated accord was signed that will send some 50 000 cuban soldiers home from angola the second reversal of cuban military imperialism after our rescue of grenada in 1983 in the matter of human rights we ve also seen extraordinary progress the release of some political prisoners in the soviet union initial steps toward a reduction of state economic controls and more politically representative forms of government some greater scope to publish and speak critically an increase in emigration and visible steps toward greater religious freedom and finally in our bilateral exchanges we re seeing more soviet and american citizens visiting each other s land and a greater interchange of scientific cultural and intellectual traditions the summits themselves are indications of the progress we ve made here i look to the day when the meetings between the leaders of the soviet union and the united states will be regular and frequent and maybe not quite so newsworthy where we re strong steadfast we succeed in the persian gulf the united states made clear its commitment to defend freedom of navigation and free world interests and this helped hasten an end to the gulf war and the country stood firm for years insisting that the plo had to accept israel s right to exist sign on to resolutions 242 and 338 and renounce terrorism and now that resolve has paid off now the democratic revolution that i talked about earlier and all the change and movement and yes breakthroughs that i ve just cited on the diplomatic front can be directly attributed to the restoration of confidence on the part of democratic nations there can be little doubt that in the decade of the eighties the cause of freedom and human rights has prospered and the specter of nuclear war has been pushed back because the democracies have recovered their strength their compass here at home a national consensus on the importance of strong american leadership is emerging as i said before the congress at the start of this year no legacy would make me more proud than leaving in place such a consensus for the cause of world freedom a consensus that prevents a paralysis of american power from ever occurring again now i think much of the reason for all of this has to do with the new coherence and clarity that we ve brought to our foreign policy a new coherence based on a strong reaffirmation of values by the allied nations the same idea that so energized mr jefferson and the other founders of this nation the idea of popular government has driven the revival of the west and a renewal of its values and its beliefs in itself but now the question how do we keep the world moving toward the idea of popular government well today i offer three thoughts reflections and warnings at the same time on how the soviet american relationship can continue to improve and how the cause of peace and freedom can be served first the soviet american relationship once marked by sterility and confrontation this relationship is now characterized by dialog realistic candid dialog serious diplomatic progress and the sights and sounds of summitry all of this is heady inspiring and yet my first reflection for you today is all of it is still in doubt and the only way to make it last and grow and become permanent is to remember we re not there yet serious problems fundamental differences remain our system is one of checks and balances theirs for all its reforms remains a one party authoritarian system that institutionalizes the concentration of power our foreign relations embrace this expanding world of democracy that i ve described theirs can be known by the company they keep cuba nicaragua ethiopia libya vietnam north korea yes we welcome mr gorbachev s recent announcement of a troop reduction but let us remember that the soviet preponderance in military power in europe remains an asymmetry that offends our jeffersonian senses and endangers our future so we must keep our heads and that means keeping our skepticism we must realize that what has brought us here has not been easy not for ourselves nor for all of those who have sacrificed and contributed to the cause of freedom in the postwar era so this means in our treaty negotiations as i ve said trust but verify i m not a linguist but i learned to say that much russian and have used it in frequent meetings with mr gorbachev dovorey no provorey it means keeping our military strong it means remembering no treaty is better than a bad treaty it means remembering the accords of moscow and washington summits followed many years of standing firm on our principles and our interests and those of our allies and finally we need to recall that in the years of detente we tended to forget the greatest weapon the democracies have in their struggle is public candor the truth we must never do that again it s not an act of belligerence to speak to the fundamental differences between totalitarianism and democracy it s a moral imperative it doesn t slow down the pace of negotiations it moves them forward throughout history we see evidence that adversaries negotiate seriously with democratic nations only when they knew the democracies harbor no illusions about those adversaries a second reflection i have on all this concerns some recent speculation that what is happening in the soviet union was in its way inevitable that since the death of stalin the soviet state would have to evolve into a more moderate and status quo power in accordance with some vague theory of convergence i think this is wrong it s also dangerous because what we see in the soviet union today is a change of a different order than in the past for example whatever the khrushchev era may or may not have represented in soviet internal politics we know how aspirations for greater freedom were crushed in poland and germany and even more bloodily in hungary we also saw the construction of the berlin wall we saw cuba become an active client state a client state spreading subversion throughout latin america and bringing the entire world to the brink of war with the missiles of october and let me assure you mr khrushchev gave no speeches at the u n like that recently given by mr gorbachev as one british u n official said about khrushchev appearances there we were never quite sure whether it was indeed mr khrushchev s shoe being used to pound the soviet desk or whether mr gromyko s shoe had been borrowed or whether there was an extra shoe kept under the soviet podium especially for banging purposes laughter now all of this was hardly encouraging for the growth of freedom and the path to peace we know too what happened in the brezhnev era greater and greater expansionism afghanistan economic decay and overwhelming corruption a greater and greater burden on the peoples of the soviet union on all the peoples of the world now this is changing how much and how fast it will change we do not know i would like to think that actions by this country particularly our willingness to make ourselves clear our expressions of firmness and will evidenced by our plain talk strong defenses vibrant alliances and readiness to use american power when american power was needed helped to prompt the reappraisal that soviet leaders have undertaken of their previous policies even more western resolve demonstrated that the hardline advocated by some within the soviet union would be fruitless just as our economic successes have set a shining example as i suggested in 1982 if the west maintained its strength we would see economic needs clash with the political order in the soviet union this has happened but it could not have happened if the west had not maintained indeed strengthened its will its commitment to world freedom so there was nothing inevitable about all of this human actions made the difference mr gorbachev has taken some daring steps as i ve said before this is the first soviet leader not to make world revolution a priority well let us credit those steps let us credit him and let us remember too that the democracies with their strength and resolve and candor have also made a difference and this is the heart of my point what happens in the next few years whether all this progress is continued or ended this is in large part up to us it s why now more then ever we must not falter american power must be exercised morally of course but it must also be exercised and exercised effectively for the cause of peace and freedom in the eighties that power made all the difference the nineties will prove no different and this brings us to my third point the relationship between the executive and the congress it s precisely where congress and the president have worked together as in afghanistan and cambodia or resolved differences as in angola the persian gulf and many aspects of u s soviet relations precisely there our policies have succeeded and we see progress but where congress and the president have engaged each other as adversaries as over central america u s policies have faltered and our common purposes have not been achieved congress on again off again indecisiveness on resisting sandinista tyranny and aggression has left central america a region of continuing danger sometimes congressional actions in foreign affairs have had the effect of institutionalizing that kind of adversarial relationship we see it in the war powers resolution in the attempted restrictions on the president s power to implement treaties and on trade policy we see it in the attempt to manage complex issues of foreign policy by the blunt instrument of legislation such as unduly restrictive intelligence oversight limits on arms transfers and earmarking of 95 percent of our foreign assistance denying a president the ability to respond flexibly to rapidly changing conditions even in arms reduction a president s ability to succeed depends on congressional support for military modernization sometimes attempts are made to weaken my hand the founding fathers understood the need for effectiveness coherence consistency and flexibility in the conduct of foreign affairs as jefferson himself said the transaction of business with foreign nations is executive altogether it belongs then to the head of that department except as to such portions of it as are specially submitted to the senate exceptions are to be construed strictly well the president and the vice president are elected by all the people so too is the congress as a collegial body all who are elected to serve in these coordinate departments of our national government have one unmistakable and undeniable mandate to preserve protect and defend the constitution to this this foremost they must always be attentive for a president it means protecting his office and its place in our constitutional framework in doing that the president is accountable to the people in the most direct way accountable to history and to his own conscience the president and congress to be sure share many responsibilities but their roles are not the same congress alone for example has the power of the purse the president is chief executive chief diplomat and commander in chief how these great branches of government perform their legitimate roles is critically important to the nation s ability to succeed nowhere more so than in the field of foreign affairs they need each other and must work together in common cause with all deference but within their separate spheres today we live in a world in which america no longer enjoys preponderant power but must lead by example and persuasion a world of pressing new challenges to our economic prosperity a world of new opportunities for peace and of new dangers in such a world more than ever america needs strong and consistent leadership and the strength and resilience of the presidency are vital i think if we can keep these concerns in mind during the coming years public debate and support will be enhanced and america s foreign policy will continue to prosper all of us know the terrible importance of maintaining the progress we ve made in the decade of the eighties we re moving away from war and confrontation toward peace and freedom and today toward a future beyond the imaginings of the past these are the stakes some may find such prospects daunting i think you should find them challenging and exciting and i think you can see that in all of this you and your country will have a special role to play the issue before the world is still the same as the one that jefferson faced so squarely and so memorably can human beings manage their own affairs is self determination and popular representative government possible mr jefferson s work and life amounted to a great mighty assent to that question so too will yours and america s if we can keep in mind the greatest and last lesson of jefferson s life and it has something to do with what i just spoke to about the executive and congress i m fond of recollecting that in the last years of their lives john adams and thomas jefferson who had worked so hard and well together for the nation s independence both came to regret that they had let partisan differences come between them for years their estrangement lasted but then when both retired jefferson at 68 to monticello and adams at 76 to quincy they began through their letters to speak again to each other letters that discussed almost every conceivable subject gardening horseback riding even sneezing as a cure for hiccups laughter but other subjects as well the loss of loved ones the mystery of grief and sorrow the importance of religion and of course the last thoughts the final hopes of two old men two great patriarchs for the country that they had helped to found and loved so deeply it carries me back jefferson wrote about his correspondence with his cosigner of the declaration of independence to the times when beset with difficulties and dangers we were fellow laborers in the same cause struggling for what is most valuable to man his right to self government laboring always at the same oar with some wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us and yet passing harmless we rowed through the storm with heart and hand it was their last gift to us this lesson in tolerance for each other in charity this insight into america s strength as a nation and when both died on the same day within hours of each other the date was july 4th 50 years exactly after that first gift to us the declaration of independence a great future is ours and the world s if we but remember the power of those words mr jefferson penned not just for americans but for all humanity that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness thank you and god bless you democracy in the soviet union q mr president and i think i can speak for everybody we really do thank you for coming to uva but my question is considering that lenin claimed that the soviets should let capitalist countries fund the building of communism i d like to know what is your position on granting most favored nation status to the soviet union and do you think if we do grant this status that it will help promote democracy in the soviet union the president well we want to help promote this democracy in the soviet union but i believe that we ve got to proceed by watching whether deeds match the words now in some instances they certainly have permitting me for example to speak to the students at the university of moscow i found out afterward however that they couldn t get all the student body in only a few hundred so they decided that the few hundred would be those who were members of the young communist league laughter but i think that there are differences between us and with this man when we had the first summit at geneva and i ll try not to make my answers this long again people more experienced in this who would be on our team told me that if we could get just the agreement to a second summit that the summit would be worthwhile well i had an idea of my own in the first meeting and as we sat they on their side of the table and my team on ours i looked across the table at the general secretary you know i don t know which to call him he s got three titles now general secretary president and chairman laughter then he was the general secretary and i suggested that why didn t we leave our teams here to start talking the subject that was raised was disarmament and why didn t he and i go out and get some air well he jumped up before i even finished speaking and out we went and it was planned there was a fire in the fireplace it was very cold that day down in a little house along the lake from below where we were so we walked down and for an hour and a half he and i had a meeting and a discussion and then we decided we d better get back up to the regular meeting laughter and we were just outside the building and he said something to me about that i had never seen russia and i turned to him and said and you have never seen the united states you ve never been in the united states before i said we re having the summit here why don t we have the next summit in the united states and i hereby invite you and he said i accept and he said then why don t we have the following one in 1987 in the soviet union i said i accept well when i told our people that we were already scheduled for two more summits laughter in our two countries they almost fell down they couldn t believe it so immediately we saw a great difference between this man and the previous leaders of the soviet union you see i hadn t had much chance to meet with them they kept dying on me laughter middle east peace efforts q mr president with regard to the recent developments with yasser arafat and the plo do you feel that this marks a culmination of your policies and your efforts to bring peace to the troubled region of the middle east the president well it is merely a step forward to that because peace which does not exist there most people forget that those countries are still technically are in a state of war with each other it s only going to come when the principals come together to negotiate outside we have been trying to help and internationally and so forth with the other nations and this has been a great step forward and again it was similar to our using strength and sticking to our purpose in other areas that brought it about we had said from the very first that there were these main points the 242 and 338 u n security council resolutions the recognition of israel s right to exist as a nation which had never been advanced before and things of this kind that had to be agreed to before we could have a dialog with the plo which was the principal opponent and when that took place as it just did for the first time clearly and without fuzzing it up with ambiguous dialog when they met those terms we said yes and already the process is going forward to arrange for that dialog but the peace must be brought about by the principals in the dispute and we re hoping that this now is the main step that will lead us toward that terrorism q mr president and i would like to congratulate you on two completely successful terms as president my question is do you believe that your policies on terrorism have been effective and will the bush administration continue these policies or embark on new ones completely on their own the president well i think that the next administration if i m correct in your question there yes will continue the policy we adopted a policy of complete resistance to terrorism no recognition of a country that supported it and there were countries that did and i think an example the shortest example that i can give you was when we had the irrefutable proof that qadhafi of libya had been responsible for terrorism that took the lives of a number of people at an airport in europe including some americans we responded and i m going to knock on wood just one more line on that since that response there has been no libyan terrorist move against any advice to youth q mr president to many people my age you re the only president we have known or at least care to remember laughter i know i speak for many of us when i say your words carry very special significance what advice do you offer us as we approach a new century in an ever more uncertain future the president oh oh laughter the age group 18 to 24 among voters is the one that is most definitely in support of the type of things that we ve been doing in these 8 years but now i have to say to you it is the age group also in which the fewest number or proportion vote so i would suggest to you because it s your world that we re talking about and if you haven t gotten around to registering or bothering to vote or you know someone that hasn t make sure that age group of yours who are going to have to take over the reins of government pretty soon that you make your views known in the polling place i think this is most vital and then oh i could lobby for an awful lot of things laughter like a balanced budget amendment and a line item veto laughter your governor has that i had it when i was governor of california the line item veto administration accomplishments q mr president welcome to the university of virginia thank you for coming and i think you ve been a great leader as everyone has said laughter thank you for your advice i d like to know what you feel are your most significant accomplishments in the areas of number one foreign policy and number two domestic policy the president what do i feel was the most important accomplishment well i think in both of those that we have redressed in foreign policy our strength when i took office on any given day half of the military aircraft of the united states couldn t fly for lack of spare parts half of the ships in our navy couldn t leave port for much the same reason or lack of crew and i immediately met with the joint chiefs of staff and wanted to talk to them about restoring a patriotism where the young men and women in uniform wouldn t feel they had to get into civilian clothes when they left the base but would be proud to be seen wearing the uniform today a higher percentage of our military are high school graduates and it s a volunteer military than ever in our history and there are three intelligence brackets used in the military for the assignment of people as to what proper functions and so forth the highest percentage in the top intelligence bracket that we have ever known before in our military and of all the things i m proud of i m proud of the young men and women who are wearing our uniform more than anything but this redressing of that but also i came into office thinking that for some time i was thinking that there was a hunger for a spiritual revival in america and i think that has taken place i hear from more and more people talking about the pride they have in country on the economic front i got a degree in economics i didn t deserve it but i got it laughter but i took away i remembered something that happened several hundred years ago laughter and it was a man named ibn khaldun in egypt i didn t know they had economists then but ibn khaldun said that at the beginning of the empire the tax rates were low and the revenue was great at the end of the empire the rates were great and the revenue was low so i came away with the belief that you didn t gain revenue by raising taxes and in fact our whole national experience proves it when coolidge took to tax reductions the revenue of the government increased and the same thing happened to a certain extent with president kennedy s tax reduction which was similar to ours so one of my first goals was to unleash the economy of this country and get government off the backs and out of an adversarial relationship with the private sector so that the people of this country could do with their freedom what they were intended to do that s all we really have done in this administration we got out of your way and we have these people that still say that we have a target of 1993 for a balanced budget and we re meeting that target on every step now but these people that still are talking that we re going to have to raise taxes they ll undo the great economic reform we have created almost 19 million new jobs in these several years of economic reform this personal disposable income after taxes has risen higher than it ever was before and government revenues from the income tax increased by 375 billion since we implemented our tax reform and our tax cut the trouble is spending increased 450 billion i haven t had a budget yet by law i have to submit a budget every year i do and present company excepted the congress just puts it on the shelf and sends me a continuing resolution of their own doing laughter so i think the great economic recovery i have had the pleasure of facing a number of our trading partners the heads of state of our trading partners japan germany france the united kingdom and on and on in a meeting and had them i was the new kid in school they d all been there longer than i had and they were sitting there silently and then one of them a spokesman said tell us about the american miracle well the american miracle was simply the unleashing of resources and the last point was regulations george bush i put in charge of a task force to see how many government regulations he could eliminate he eliminated so many that our estimate today is that the paperwork imposed upon you and on community governments and on state governments has been reduced by 600 million man hours a year well i got too long on that answer laughter president s future plans q mr president you are of course near the end of your second term after the inauguration of george bush what does the future hold for ronald reagan the president well you know in hollywood if you don t sing or dance you wind up as an after dinner speaker laughter and so that was my personal appearance role was a speaker out there on the mashed potato circuit laughter and there are always i think for everyone who ever leaves this post there are things you didn t get done and i think i ll be out on the mashed potato circuit again extolling the virtues of line item veto and a balanced budget amendment laughter and again defending the right of us to maintain our military defenses and so forth and i m very tempted about the idea somebody s talking to me about doing a book and there are some backstage stories that i might enjoy getting out laughter but i m going to be active i m not going to be up at the ranch any more than much that i ve been able to on the visits that i occasionally make there but i m going to be active and i know that nancy s going to continue her activity in the antidrug campaign too were you the last one or is there a sixth did i miscount mr o neil that was the sixth the president that was the sixth all right i miscounted laughter thank you very much
